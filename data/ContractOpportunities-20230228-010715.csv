STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change.   Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change. Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected. For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:  https://www.usaid.gov/stabilization-and-transitions INTRODUCTION The OTI Deputy Country Representative - Ecuador is a member of the Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative.

In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs).

This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect.

Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.).

The Health Office, comprised of 57 staff, manages a multifaceted program addressing maternal-child health, reproductive health/family planning, infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria), health systems strengthening, global health security, and human resource issues. Three approaches guide the overall program for improving the health status of Zambians: Strengthening Health Systems and Accountability, Improving Health Service Delivery, and Improving Community Health Practices. Success is measured by achieving progress towards an AIDS-Free generation, making strategic investments in women and saving mothers, and ending preventable childhood death. High-quality Strategic Information is essential for success in all these areas. The Health Office works closely with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services, the Ministry of Finance, the Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency, the National Food and Nutrition Commission, and other cooperating partners including donors, in support of the National Health Strategic Plan and the National HIV/TB/STI Council (NAC), as it manages implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework (NASF).  The Health Office also collaborates with the Education, Economic Growth, and Democracy and Governance Offices at USAID/Zambia to implement integrated health programs across multiple sectors.  The Strategic Information (SI) Division Chief position coordinates cross-cutting strategic information interventions, designed to strengthen government capacity and systems and improve transparency and accountability, and to permit regular reporting to USAID/Washington and other relevant USG entities, and provide timely data for USAID to make operational decisions that directly influence results obtained.","Mar 05, 2023 05:00 PM GMT","Feb 3, 2023","Feb 3, 2023","Solicitation","Kamuchizya Mutambo","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Personal Services","PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS","N/A","N/A"

SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Secret POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI in the forthcoming solicitation. INTRODUCTION The OTI Program Assistant will be a member of the CPS/OTI Field Programs Division Management Team, the CPS/OTI FPD Program Performance Management (PPM) or Creative & Digital Teams (CDT), or one of CPS/OTI’s Regional Teams, and reports to one of the two FPD Deputy Chiefs, or their designee, or the OTI Regional Team Leader or their designee, and is based in Washington, DC. The FPD Management Team overseas regional teams, program strategy, workforce planning and budgets for the division. The FPD PPM and CDT teams consist of technical advisors and specialists in areas including but not limited to M&E, PPM, Data Analysis, Graphic Design and media and provide direct support to OTI country programs. OTI currently has six regional teams as part of FPD: West Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Southern and Eastern Africa, and Middle East and Asia. OTI’s Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  The Program Assistant’s principal responsibility is to assist the FPD Management Team, the PPM and CDT teams, or one of OTI’s regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, focused on country program implementation support. The Program Assistant must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful offeror will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, be able to build and maintain collaborative relationships with staff in other support divisions and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.  BASIS OF RATING:  Offerors who clearly meet the Education/Experience Requirements and Selection Factors will be further evaluated in accordance with the Offeror Rating System. Those offerors determined to be competitively ranked may also be evaluated on interview performance and satisfactory professional reference checks. In the event that a offeror has fully demonstrated their qualifications and there are no other competitive offerors, OTI reserves the right to forego the interview process.","Feb 16, 2023 01:00 PM EST","Feb 1, 2023","Feb 1, 2023","Presolicitation","OTI Recruitment Team","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Other General Government Support","PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS","N/A","N/A"

MARKET VALUE:  $99,908-$129,878 per annum (equivalent to GS-14). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value. 7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The U.S. Personal Services Contract will be for two-year contract with options for three, one-year extensions. 8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  The duty post for this contract is Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic. While the selected candidate is expected to work eight hours per day during the core working hours of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic. Overseas USPSCs may be authorized to telework or remote work only from a location within the country of performance, in accordance with Mission policy. Telework or remote work from outside the country of performance may only be authorized in certain situations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract 9.  ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: U.S. Citizens and Third Country Nationals 10. SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED:  Facility Access II. STATEMENT OF DUTIES BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION: The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, landlocked and mountainous country in Central Asia with a population of approximately 6.5 million people. It is the second-poorest country in Central Asia, with one-third of the population living below the poverty line. Many of the country’s long standing, systemic challenges have been exacerbated by COVID-19. The health system is defined by uncoordinated, disease-specific stovepipe structures, which prevent improvements in the care and treatment of infectious diseases.  Malnutrition remains a threat in rural areas, and in the education sector, Ministry efforts have failed to address long-standing gaps in learning and job-preparation.  Moreover, the World Bank estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic may drive the Kyrgyz Republic poverty rate up to 44%, from 22% in 2018, reversing 15 years of progress. Pre-pandemic, more than one million Kyrgyzstanis worked as labor migrants in Russia, generating a third of the country’s GDP through remittances. Pandemic-driven border closures and economic shutdowns have stifled remittances, impacting thousands of economically vulnerable families. To address such challenges, USAID continues to build effective programs that share development priorities with the GOKR and Kyrgyzstani communities.  In the health sector, through USAID support, the country has piloted cutting-edge approaches to control infectious disease and address chronic malnutrition, programming ~$9 million in HIV, TB, and nutrition in FY 22 and managing an additional $10 million of  American Rescue Plan Act funding for pandemic response & recovery. Beginning in FY 2023, USAID will begin receiving Global Health Security (GHS) funding.  The Global Health Security Agenda is a global initiative that was launched by the White House on February 13, 2014. GHSA’s goal is to advance a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to elevate global health security as a national leaders-level priority. In 2014, member countries developed 11 lines of effort– known as Action Packages – that work across human health, animal health, and other sectors to help countries achieve GHSA objectives and meet country requirements for the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) and related animal health regulations.  GHS is slated to increasingly absorb the COVID-19 pandemic response activities of USAID/Kyrgyz Republic going forward, while existing global health programming in Kyrgyz Republic related to HIV, nutrition, and TB will also bolster GHS targets. The U.S. Agency for International Development seeks to employ a U.S./TCN PSC Senior Global Health Security Advisor who will be responsible for providing technical leadership and support for a range of health and health security issues in the Kyrgyz Republic, including ensuring well-coordinated and effective program implementation of the Agency’s GHS portfolio in Kyrgyz Republic.

This position will be under the supervision of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic Health and Education Office Director and also fulfill the deputy role in the office.

ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: U.S. Citizens 10. SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: USG Secret Clearance 11. STATEMENT OF DUTIES OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM AND ROLE OF THE POSITION: The USAID/Mozambique Integrated Health Office (IHO) provides leadership and technical assistance to the Government of the Republic of Mozambique’s Ministry of Health (MoH) in the areas of Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Family Planning, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and other Neglected Tropical Diseases, as well as significant support to strengthening host-country health systems. Supply chain management and pharmaceutical commodity security are key components of the IHO’s health systems strengthening (HSS) portfolio with significant contributions in commodity procurement and technical assistance to the MoH and in particular its Central Medical Stores - Central de Medicamentos e Artigos Médicos (CMAM) to improve warehousing, distribution, planning and supply chain management. Commodities procured and distributed include contraceptives, condoms, Anti-Retrovirals (ARVs), HIV and malaria test kits, TB and anti-malaria drugs, laboratory reagents and supplies, vaccine supplies and equipment, and MCH and other commodities required for HIV/AIDS and health program implementation. The MoH’s supply chain system has experienced a number of challenges, including shortages of qualified personnel, insufficient state and donor financing, and limited coordination between its departments and donors. Over the last several years, this has led to stock-outs of essential and vital medicines, loss of valuable health supplies through expiration or other means, and reduced access to health supplies for the Mozambican population. Supply chain challenges hamper the MoH’s efforts to achieve its health sector goals and the success of United States Government (USG) health assistance to Mozambique through its interagency team comprised of USAID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Peace Corps. The Mozambican Minister of Health and Ministry of Health senior management have prioritized improving supply-chain performance and ensuring the appropriate policies, systems, and capacities are in place for effective supply-chain governance, performance, and transparency. The Pharmaceutical Logistics Strategic Plan (PELF) provides future directions for the health supply chain.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES  POSITION DESCRIPTION  BACKGROUND  USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified  individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for  priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI  helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support  of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to  promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile  programming.  Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from  civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely  and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the  difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding  indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such  mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of  initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help  projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.  To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a  group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force  and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.  Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as “bullpenners,”  providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both  in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. There are several benefits that  USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as  well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete  information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.  OTI’s Core Values:  Agility  OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and  strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates  timely positive change. 4 | Page  Political  OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we  acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power  dynamics and harness them for transformation.  Accountability  OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of  responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance  with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer.  Curiosity  OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder  about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid  uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches.  Diversity & Inclusion  OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective  responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the  diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect.  Courage  OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with  intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle  difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change.  OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global  community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we  value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.   Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust  ? Model open communication, active listening and candor.  ? Believe others when they share their experiences.  Respect  ? A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone.  ? Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while  recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences. 5 | Page  Belonging (Accessibility)  ? Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). ? Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior.  Empathy  ? Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel.  ? Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability  ? Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. ? Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and  influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted.  ? Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when  confronted/corrected.  For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:   https://www.usaid.gov/stabilization-and-transitions  INTRODUCTION  The Senior Transition Advisor is a member of USAID’s Bureau for Conflict Prevention and  Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), and is considered an expert in the field  of political transition programming overseas with strong program management, budgetary and  operational skills.

SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Top Secret POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI in the forthcoming solicitation.

The incumbent must possess a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, must be eligible for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access, and successfully pass a Counterintelligence Polygraph test for site access at the Liberty Park location. BASIS OF RATING:  Offerors who clearly meet the Education/Experience Requirements and Selection Factors set forth in the coming solicitation will be further evaluated based on scoring of the Evaluation Factor responses. Offerors who meet these minimum qualifications will be reviewed against set Evaluation Factors, describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor. Failure to specifically address the Selection and/or Evaluation Factors may result in your not receiving credit for all of your pertinent experience, education, training and/or awards.  The most qualified offerors may be interviewed, required to provide a writing sample, and demonstrate an ability to operate commonly used office applications. OTI will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, offers (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the offerors writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that an offeror has fully demonstrated their qualifications and there are no other competitive offerors, OTI reserves the right to forgo the interview process. Professional references and academic credentials will be evaluated for offerors being considered for selection. Offerors must submit at least three (3) professional references, one (1) of which must be a current or former supervisor. OTI reserves the right to contact previous employers to verify employment history.  If the offeror had a previous position with USAID, the TEC and/or CO are encouraged to obtain reference checks from the previous supervisor(s) or CO(s). See ADS 309.3.1.11.a.4 The Government may award a contract without discussions with offerors in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. The CO reserves the right at any point in the evaluation process to establish a competitive range of offerors with whom negotiations will be conducted pursuant to FAR 15.306(c).

OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change.   Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected.

"RFI-2023-001","Sudan Local Partner, U.S, and International Partner Outreach- Request for Information","The RFI is amended on  January 9, 2023. Please go to the Attachments/ links tab to access to the Amendment 001 to the RFI. Minor revisions - updated on 27 December 2022. OVERVIEW: At the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), we work hard to build a world that is safer, healthier, and more prosperous for people everywhere. Partnering is at the heart of that effort. As USAID Administrator Samantha Power has noted, the quality of the Agency’s partnerships represents “the essence of whether the development we do will be sustained over me.” The USAID/Sudan Mission seeks to expand the Agency's partnering potential by improving collaboration with new, non-traditional, and local actors—while enhancing local leadership, capacity, and accountability in all that we do. The New Partnerships Initiative (NPI) was launched in 2019 as part of an effort to implement the principles of the Agency’s Acquisition and Assistance Strategy, primarily diversifying USAID’s partner base and changing how the Agency partners. NPI seeks to lower the barriers faced by non-traditional partners—including local actors, U.S. small businesses, faith-based organization, cooperatives, diaspora groups, and civil society organizations—so that the Agency can embrace the diverse potential of the partnering community in pursuit of our shared development goals. The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Mission in Sudan, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information and potential interest from organizations to diversify USAID’s partner base. Request for Information (RFI) RFI Number: USAID/Sudan-RFI 2023-001 The goal of the RFI is to 1) diversify USAID/Sudan’s partner base by creating avenues for new and underutilized partners to work with USAID, and 2) support partners to become self-reliant and capable of leading their own development journeys. To achieve this, USAID/Sudan intends to promote funding and capacity development opportunities for local organizations to achieve locally-led and sustainable development outcomes. These efforts may include designing and implementing solutions with a full range of development partners, mobilizing resources across local systems, and fostering accountability for the results. Potential development results may emerge from partnerships with many different actors, such as for-profit, non-profit, diaspora, private sector, universities, research institutes, and other entities. RESPONSE REQUESTED: USAID/Sudan Mission requests information to identify and better  understand the wide range and capabilities of organizations to implement development projects of varying sizes and types and across various technical sectors. USAID/Sudan also desires to gather information on the number and type of local Partners operating in different geographic locations of Sudan to consider eligible organizations for future solicitations/partnership opportunities. Responses received from this Request for Information (RFI) will help the Mission identify organizations interested in working with USAID/Sudan Mission and potential partners for future co-creation opportunities. Please review Attachment A for the information requested. Responses to this RFI are requested as soon as practicable. While the RFI has an intentionally long timeframe for submissions - until June 30, 2023, please do not wait until June 2023 to submit responses. Please note USAID is not seeking a technical or cost proposal for any partnerships at this me. Do not submit any proposal or application in response to this RFI. Only the information requested in Attachment-A will be considered. Issuance of this notice does not constitute an award commitment on the part of USAID, nor does it commit USAID to pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of responses.","Jun 30, 2023 05:00 PM EDT","Jan 9, 2023","Jan 9, 2023","Sources Sought","Erik Singer, Supervisory Contracting Officer","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

STATEMENT OF DUTIES GENERAL STATEMENT OF PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: Background The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) is responsible for facilitating and coordinating U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance overseas in response to all types of international disasters, including slow-onset disasters such as droughts or famine, natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods, or man-made disasters such as conflict or war. BHA is responsible for planning, coordinating, developing, achieving, monitoring, and evaluating international humanitarian assistance within the following:  ?       Humanitarian Response activities comprise needs-based humanitarian assistance provided to save lives, alleviate suffering, and protect human dignity during and in the aftermath of emergencies. Grounded in humanitarian principles, humanitarian assistance is directed toward the most vulnerable populations.  ?       Early Recovery, Risk Reduction, and Resilience (ER4) activities will set the initial foundations for longer-term recovery, as appropriate, and will work in close conjunction with humanitarian and development assistance. Early recovery is an approach that supports communities impacted by crises to protect and restore basic systems and service delivery. Early recovery builds on humanitarian response efforts and establishes the initial foundations of long-term recovery. Early recovery activities are implemented for a specified, appropriate timeframe and assist populations recovering from an identifiable shock. Risk reduction is the prevention of new and reduction of existing disaster risk and management of residual risk, which contributes to strengthening resilience and to the achievement of sustainable development. Resilience is the ability of people, households, communities, countries, and systems to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses in a manner that reduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth. BHA has seven offices, as follows: The Bureau’s three geographic offices are: (1) Office of Africa; (2) Office of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean; and (3) the Office of the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.  Each geographic office designs, provides, and assesses humanitarian assistance for their respective regions, including assistance related to responding to, recovering from, and reducing the risk of man-made and natural disasters, while linking with other USAID investments that build resilience. The Office of Global Policy, Partnerships, Programs, and Communications (G3PC) shapes and influences USAID’s role within the international humanitarian system; leads engagement on a range of policy, programmatic, and operational issues; and positions the Agency to influence collective response to emergency needs across the globe. The Office of Technical and Program Quality (TPQ) leads the Bureau's efforts to provide high-quality programmatic and technical leadership, oversight, and guidance. In addition, TPQ leads the Bureau’s external engagement with academia and coordinates research to advance the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of humanitarian and multi-year programming. The Office of Humanitarian Business and Management Operations (HBMO) is responsible for maintaining 24/7 operability by providing leadership, planning, quality assurance, technical expertise, and process management.  HBMO ensures effective stewardship of the Bureau’s support services, including workforce planning, staffing, financial management, internal controls, facilities operations and infrastructure. The Office of Field and Response Operations (FARO) leads and manages operational assistance and the purchase and delivery of goods and services in response to declared foreign disasters and international humanitarian needs in key functional areas, including supply-chain management, procurement, logistics, oversight, and operational coordination with the U.S. military. Introduction BHA is committed to fostering an equitable and inclusive workplace with a diverse workforce and encourages qualified candidates of all races/ethnicities, genders, cultural backgrounds, abilities, and socioeconomic statuses to apply. The Office of Asia Latin America and Caribbean (ALAC) designs, provides, and assesses humanitarian assistance, including assistance related to responding to, recovering from, and reducing the risk of man-made and natural disasters, while linking with other USAID investments that build resilience. To achieve these objectives, humanitarian experts based overseas coordinate with local authorities and USAID Missions, while humanitarian experts based in Washington, D.C. coordinate with USAID Regional and Pillar Bureaus. The Office of ALAC consists of (3) three geographic divisions: Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and the Pacific, and South and Central Asia (SCA).

"7200AA22R00077","Legal Advisors","The Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services, Overseas Management Division, (M/MS/OMD), is hiring Legal Advisors, who will be U.S. Personal Services Contractors (USPSCs) on intermittent contracts. The intermittent USPSCs for these awards will be members of the “Legal Tiger Team”.  The Legal Tiger Team members will provide rapid response to urgent demands, additional specialized skills, or requests for services that cannot otherwise be accomplished in a country where personnel have been displaced, or where there has been a surge of activity that exceeds the capacity of that of USAID’s personnel. The USPSC must be prepared to work abroad in USAID missions and embassies, often with little time for preparations.  Legal Tiger Team members are expected to deploy a minimum of 60 days per contract year to remain active Tiger Team members. Deployments can be for any period of time from two (2) weeks to almost a full year. At the time the USPSC accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. The USPSC shall notify USAID at the time of assignment commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the USPSC from the assignment but will simply assist USAID in recruiting a replacement. However, if a USPSC is not available for the minimum number of work assignments offered during a contract year (a minimum of 60 cumulative days), or performance reviews are rated unsuccessful, USAID may choose not to exercise the option years of the PSC’s contract, thus terminating their contract after the first year. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) – such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits.  ","Jun 30, 2023 12:00 PM EDT","May 16, 2022","May 16, 2022","Solicitation","Srijana Rana | Ousmane S.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES: BACKGROUND The USAID Mission in Kosovo was opened in July 1999 and much of the focus was on preparing Kosovo for independence and establishing basic institutions necessary for a democracy to function. During this period, Kosovo was established as an internationally administered region, administered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Since 1999, over $1.2 billion in U.S. assistance was committed to the reconstruction of Kosovo and to building self-governing institutions and a viable economy. In February 2008, Kosovo declared independence. The creation of Europe's newest state has proceeded on a forward path despite setbacks. Starting from virtually zero, Kosovo today is a functioning state, with a functioning government and a society that is growing stronger and more self-confident. The handover process of Kosovo's nascent institutions from UN control to the new Government of Kosovo (GOK) has highlighted the young state's growing maturity and capacity. USAID/Kosovo is presently a medium-sized Mission with 99 staff positions (16 USDHs, 6 USPSCs, and 77 CCNs). The Mission manages an active portfolio valued at approximately $140 million.

"72016819RFI002","Investment vehicle to facilitate access to finance","USAID Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (USAID BiH) would like to invite capabilities statements for a potential partnership from organizations or private sector partners for the creation of a pooled investment vehicle or a non-bank financial institution seeking innovative approaches to capital allocation. The goal of this initiative is to improve the flow of private capital and foster entrepreneurship to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), early stage enterprises (enterprises that are less than three years old), and start-ups operating in BiH. Based on the European Commission definition, an SME is defined as an enterprise that employs fewer than 250 people with an annual turnover of less than 50 million Euro. For the purposes of this RFI, a start-up is an enterprise that is less than six months old. The capabilities statement must come from one or more legal entities with investment management experience. USAID is looking for organizations/partnerships who can address the lack of access to finance for startups and SMEs. USAID might commit up to $2 million for a period of up to 5 years (with a possible extension of not more than 5 additional years) towards an investment vehicle. The prospective partners would be expected to bring financial resources of their own into the possible award (cash equivalent for the leverage of no less than 1:1). Please note: This is NOT a request for applications or proposals. Only simple expressions of interest should be submitted at this stage. USAID may release a full request for applications (RFA) or proposals (RFP) at a later date, through the U.S. Government portal (www.FBO.gov or www.grants.gov). The technical requirements and the final level of funding will be determined before the actual RFA/RFP is released. Please see attached document 72016819RFI002 for details.

Degree of responsibility for decision-making assigned to the position. The incumbent will be expected to be the primary decision maker regarding the system of maintaining and upgrading the MCP dataset. Level of complexity of work assignments and work environment. Maintaining the MCP dataset and applying the data to empirical research efforts will entail highly complex assignments. The quality and quantity of the data are continuously evolving, and require much good judgment and analysis as to their applicability. Moreover, a key part of the job will be to help simplify complex trends so that a ""non-technical"" audience (including key policy makers) can understand them and constructively use them to facilitate programmatic decisions. Knowledge level required. The incumbent must have considerable knowledge in empirical research, including data collection and manipulation, some statistical techniques, and knowledge in interpreting data trends. Similarly, s/he must be knowledgeable in social science research methodologies. In addition, knowledge regarding transition countries and economic and social development in low and middle-income countries is very important. Across Supervisory Controls. The incumbent is expected to work closely with his/her supervisor, who will provide general feedback and guidelines as needed, likely on a daily basis at least initially. Guidelines. Broad guidelines include the Freedom Support and SEED Acts; Foreign Assistance Act as amended; appropriation acts; report parameters as set by the State Department Coordinators Office; and USAID directives and policies. Scope and effect. The incumbent will be involved in the collection and application of a large data set, across the transition region (and compared to countries outside the region), and across the three main sectors of USAID focus, namely, economic, democracy, and social. The MCP system has had direct relevance to programmatic and resource allocations decisions in USAID and more broadly within the State Department. Level and purpose of contacts. Given the central and coordinating role of the Program Office and the MCP system, the incumbent will be expected to collaborate with a wide range of colleagues, within USAID (within E&E as well as other Bureaus, pillar and geographic bureaus; in Washington and in the field) and within the USG community more broadly (in the State Department primarily) and among other donors and organizations (e.g., World Bank, EBRD, Freedom House). These contacts and collaboration are needed to maintain reality checks or quality checks on the data, and to ensure ""clients"" are best served. Supervision of others.

BRICC Task Order (TO) holder(s) (e.g. BRICC Contractor(s)) shall achieve this RO by working with stakeholders to achieve five intermediate results (IRs): (1) Essential services restored and accessible; (2) inclusive, participatory, accountable, and transparent governance strengthened; (3) livelihoods restored and economies revived; (4) access to education and vocational training expanded; and (5) access to healthcare, mental health, and psycho-social support services expanded. To achieve this RO, BRICC TO Holders shall apply an integrated, multi-sectoral, conflict-sensitive approach across all IRs. TO Holders shall coordinate and collaborate closely with other USAID and U.S. Government (USG) activities and like-minded donors.   BRICC implementers are expected to retain a Rapid Response Capacity to quickly adapt and respond to the dynamic context in Syria by being able to quickly identify and deploy short-term technical and operational staff to support the overall BRICC RO as well as individual TOs.   Offerors must establish a team of diverse partners that demonstrate technical expertise to efficiently and effectively execute the full range of the possible tasks and show strong familiarity with the diverse populations in Syria. Offerors will be expected to demonstrate how they intend to manage, coordinate, utilize and integrate sub-contractors, grantees and other partners, as well as lay out a process to cultivate and nurture Syrian organizations as implementing partners. BRICC implementers will initially launch in areas outside of Regime control in northeast Syria. If the political, legal, and security situation permits, BRICC may expand to other parts of Syria. The scope of services under this IDIQ are not substantially or predominantly construction services. However, as part of the overall effort, implementers may be required to undertake ancillary construction services including rehabilitation and restoration of services. Part II: Task Order 1 The objective of the Syria Essential Services and Livelihoods (SES+L) Task Order (TO) 1 is to advance the BRICC RO by delivering services to achieve three of the BRICC IDIQ Intermediate Results (IRs): IR 1. Essential services restored and accessible; IR 2. Inclusive, participatory, accountable, and transparent governance strengthened; and IR 3. Livelihoods restored and local economies revived. The program will initially implement in northeast Syria and must be able to cover the whole of Syria, including the ability to implement activities in newly liberated areas, as the legal and policy parameters permit. The primary means of accomplishing the SES+L Task Order objective is through participatory, community-based approaches to essential services, good governance, and livelihoods. The SES+L Task Order Holder shall bring together diverse Syrian actors and other regional and international partners to help Syrians sustainably restore and manage essential services, strengthen governance processes, and jumpstart economic recovery.  End of Pre-solicitation Notice","N/A","Jul 11, 2019","Jul 11, 2019","Presolicitation","Hourig DelDelian | Michael Ashkouri","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","SUPPORT SVCS (PROF, ADMIN, MGMT)","N/A","N/A"

STATEMENT OF DUTIES GENERAL STATEMENT OF PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: Country Context Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, is a key strategic partner for the U.S. in South and Southeast Asia. Bangladesh has made dramatic progress in many sectors and won fame as a development laboratory, despite a population of over 165 million people in an area the size of Iowa. Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, though progress has been made in spite of the economic drag natural hazards, such as cyclones and floods, have had on the economy. Recently, however, the consolidation of political power into the hands of one party and regressive legislative initiatives have restricted the space for civil society, increased corruption, and reduced respect for human rights. Bangladesh's secular democracy and economic trajectory are further jeopardized by virulent groups like ISIS and al Qaeda as well as creeping authoritarianism. Within this context, Bangladesh continues to struggle with the extraordinary humanitarian and development needs of over one million Rohingya refugees and the Bangladeshi host and impacted communities living in and around the refugee camps. The USAID Mission is co-located with the Embassy, and enjoys close working relationships across all sectors with interagency counterparts. USAID leads or participates in several interagency working groups, and Mission leadership is called upon to serve in acting roles in the Embassy front office. USAID is a leader in the donor community, and plays a key role in donor-Government relations. Overall, the relationship with the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) remains strong and robust, across all development sectors. USAID Program Priorities In this context, USAID/Bangladesh implements the Asia Bureau's largest portfolio, promoting a prosperous, stable, tolerant and secular Bangladesh.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The U.S. Personal Services Contract will be for two years, subject to possible extensions. 8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Almaty, Kazakhstan 9. ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: U.S. Citizens 10. SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Secret 11. STATEMENT OF DUTIES 1. Basic Function of the Position The Senior Regional Development Outreach & Communications Coordinator (DOC), working with the entire mission staff, serves an important role in the USAID Central Asia (CA) Mission. From developing, producing, and disseminating information about the mission's activities to helping organize VIP visits, the DOCs' primary role is to act as a one-stop resource that provides concise and appropriate information regarding USAID's work and the impact of that work on the citizens it affects. The DOC has a two-dimensional job-one that requires proactive tasks, like strategic planning and shaping the public's perception of USAID's assistance, as well as reactive tasks, like responding to last-minute inquiries and requests for information. The degree to which these areas are balanced is dictated by the varying pace of activity at the mission, which can differ regularly. The DOC also plays a valuable role in helping mission staff to understand how to comply with USAID branding and marking regulations and how the host country's local audience perceives its programs. USAID/CA manages a complex development portfolio in a heavily politicized environment. The current $104 million bilateral and regional portfolio covers Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan across a broad range of health, education, democracy and governance, economic development, and environment activities. USAID/CA also works closely with neighboring missions, primarily Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kyrgyz Republic, on regional programming. The USAID/CA DOC reports directly to the Strategy and Program Office (SPO) Director. The SPO is responsible for the mission's strategic approach and adherence to this approach, ADS and Congressional compliance, program budget process and management, environmental compliance, gender and inclusive development, monitoring and evaluation, program cycle compliance and processes, and strategic communications and outreach. DOC activities are of exceptionally broad scope and complexity. In this capacity, the incumbent is responsible for strategically planning, developing, implementing, and administering communications and outreach to promote better awareness and understanding of U.S. foreign assistance. The DOC is required to professionally and efficiently cooperate and coordinate with mission and embassy officers, USAID headquarters, mission leadership and project managers, local partners, and implementing partners and external stakeholders to implement strategic, forward-thinking development outreach and communications efforts to increase awareness of USAID assistance programs in Central Asia, both to internal and external audiences. S/he leads the development outreach and communications team, and supervises two staff professionals. As required by USAID policy, the DOC liaises with USAID's Asia and Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) Bureaus in Washington to ensure close coordination and streamlined messaging and learning. The DOC serves the mission as an ‘interpreter' of complex USAID processes (e.g. branding and marking, USAID outreach policies and procedures, public relations, media engagement, etc.); the messenger of the mission's alignment with USAID strategy and U.S. Foreign Assistance and Policy; facilitator of targeted influential public outreach; and presenter of programming results and accomplishments to internal and external audiences. Target audiences could be journalists, an ambassador, a visiting Congressional delegation, embassy interagency staff, Washington decision makers, implementing partners, or mission staff, thus requiring multifaceted messaging and public relations approaches. The DOC is the principal drafter or on final clearance for all public materials, including social media, press releases, media engagement, fact sheets, and talking points. The DOC works closely with and coordinates these efforts with the USAID Country Offices in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and with the mission's liaison office in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, and, as needed, the USAID Mission in the Kyrgyz Republic. The DOC works closely with interagency teams at the different Central Asian U.S. embassies, principally the Public Affairs Section (PAS), and is responsible for pro-actively coordinating closely with these embassies regarding press, media inquiries, messaging, and embassy awareness of and engagement in public events. Balancing the bilateral and U.S. foreign assistance messaging needs of embassies at the same time as strategically messaging the USAID agenda can be a complex arrangement, requiring a politically savvy DOC with strong interpersonal and communication skills. The DOC is expected to travel regionally based on the needs of the USAID/Central Asia (CA) Mission. It is estimated that the DOC will travel once a quarter. TDY durations will normally range between 1 - 2 weeks, and could be longer or shorter, more or less frequent depending on mission requirements. The workspace is in a shared office with large windows and natural light. 2. Major Duties and Responsibilities: Specific duties include, but are not limited to, the following: Management of the DOC Unit (15%) • Managing the DOC unit including: positively and constructively managing staff and budgets; creating an annual communications and strategy and implementation plan; and setting priorities for the accomplishment of the strategy and plan. • Supervising two professional staff, including providing on-the-job training and delegating assignments, with clear roles and responsibilities and accountability, who assist in the function and success of the DOC unit. • Ensuring DOC staff has the necessary training, resources, support, and guidance to productively operate with high morale. • Providing overall strategic direction and coordinating DOC efforts with USAID communications liaisons in country offices to ensure consistent messaging and quality communications products across the region. • Serving as the senior advisor to mission management regarding all public information, media relations, and outreach matters. • Overseeing the publication of materials and social media campaigns. • Supervising the maintenance of DOC programmatic records, communications materials, and files. • Managing the mission website and the internal SPO website. • Building and maintaining high-level contacts within the larger U.S. Government community and with implementing partners and other stakeholders in the region, • Maintaining up-to-date knowledge of all USAID/CA strategies, objectives, activities, and processes, as well as a keen awareness of political and policy issues. • Serving as a resident expert on USAID branding and style guidelines as outlined in ADS 320 and the Agency's Graphic Standards Manual.

Access to venture capital is rare and mentoring and business advisory services are limited.  As a result, many high-potential MSMEs in Haiti lack the modern business systems and skills needed to grow and expand – with significant opportunity cost to the Haitian economy.   New solutions are needed which can cost-effectively identify and strengthen support high-potential MSMEs to access capital and markets, which could include, but are not limited to:   Support in identifying and addressing systemic challenges constraining MSME growth and financing in Haiti including enabling environment challenges around contract enforcement, loan collateral, licenses, tax administration and property rights. Establishing a network of performance -based business advisory services providers and specialized industry expertise Formation of or support to angel or venture funds or facilities to nurture and finance high-potential MSMEs Formation or support of an incubator or accelerator Establishment of an e-learning platform and/or Fintech strategies and instruments Support for the Center for Investment Facilitation and/or engagement with the diaspora to leverage skills and funding Support to develop and expand competent advisory services capacity within Haiti (potentially through a university or technical school) Incentives and risk mitigation strategies to encourage Haitian finance providers to extend MSME financing Fintech and other web-based matchmaking and crowd sourcing platforms to raise capital.   Other solutions/approaches have been used as well to best identify and promote high-potential MSMEs around the world. The purpose of this BAA is to test and pilot these solutions (or combinations thereof) and to gather data to determine which will be most effective and efficient in accomplishing this.","Jun 03, 2019 04:30 PM EDT","May 3, 2019","May 3, 2019","Special Notice","Sabrina Silva | Esteban Enriquez-Salazar","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT","N/A","N/A"

STATEMENT OF DUTIES 1. General Statement of Purpose of the Contract Despite maintaining one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the world, Ethiopia remains beset by severe challenges that threaten its development gains. Nearly 30 million Ethiopians live at or near the poverty line. A single shock-such as a drought, outbreak of conflict, or illness-can plunge a household into a food security crisis. Multiple, consecutive years of slow-onset disasters (droughts, disease) have left nearly 18 million Ethiopians on some form of food assistance, and recent outbreaks of inter communal conflict have led to massive internal displacement in several parts of the country. At the same time, the country continues to host one of the largest refugee populations in Africa. USAID/Ethiopia's Office of Assets and Livelihoods in Transition (ALT) implements a diverse portfolio of activities that aims to save lives, build resilience, and enhance the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia. The office manages 23 active awards that reach more than eight million direct beneficiaries with agriculture and livelihoods support, nutrition programming, disaster risk management, and food assistance. Humanitarian food assistance and emergency nutrition comprise the largest single element in the portfolio, with six current activities combining for a life of portfolio value of more than $1 billion. The ALT Office houses one of the largest Food for Peace programs in the world and its emergency activities include both in-kind and market-based assistance. The Humanitarian Food Assistance Advisor provides oversight and leadership to ALT's emergency portfolio. S/he will develop and execute USAID strategies, priorities and programs for food assistance to save lives, reduce suffering, and support the early recovery of people affected by humanitarian crises. As ALT's focal point for emergency programs, s/he will monitor, analyze and guide reporting on the humanitarian situation and developments across Ethiopia, with particular focus on the food security impacts of ongoing and potential humanitarian crises. S/he will analyze and assess data from a variety of sources - including field assessments, technical data, early warning information, and reporting from USAID staff, NGOs, and PIOs - to inform Title II food aid funding decisions, modifications to ongoing programs, and recommend appropriate food assistance activities. In a fast-paced and continually shifting complex emergency context, the incumbent develops immediate solutions in times of crisis to enable Food for Peace to respond to the food security needs of its targeted beneficiaries The incumbent is deeply engaged in the Government of Ethiopia's humanitarian coordination community and the UN cluster system. S/he has overall responsibility for ensuring coordination and coherence of the office's investment in humanitarian activities and works closely with the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration to influence and shape the direction of their complementary humanitarian investments in-country. S/he represents USAID and liaises with senior leadership of the Government of Ethiopia, major donors and partners on humanitarian assistance and emergency food security forums.

"72066319B00001","Senior Learning Advisor","  1.      STATEMENT OF DUTIES   1.      General Statement of Purpose of the Contract   As part of the Mission’s Program Office, the incumbent will serve as USAID/Ethiopia’s Senior Learning Advisor and will institutionalize Collaborating, Learning and Adapting (CLA) across the Mission portfolio. The incumbent is expected to serve as an expert organizational learning and knowledge management professional.   CLA is USAID’s methodology and approach to ensure programming is coordinated, grounded in evidence, and is adjusted as necessary to remain effective throughout the program cycle. The incumbent guides and supports coordinated Program Office learning initiatives, both on a programmatic and operational level, and supports Mission Management and wider Mission staff in implementing the Mission strategy through mechanisms or approaches that promote continuous learning and adaptation. These mechanisms or approaches  are not yet fully established or universally adopted, and the incumbent will lead and promote their development. The incumbent also promotes strong internal and external collaboration and stakeholder engagement and supports program coordination. S/he plays a Mission-wide coordination role and provides advice to the Mission Director, Deputy Mission Director, the Mission Management Team (MMT), and other offices on best and emerging practices in institutionalizing CLA. S/he leads staff to develop Mission-wide processes that integrate CLA across the Mission, makes recommendations on how to continuously improve processes and project outcomes, and fosters improved communication internally and with external stakeholders. The incumbent also serves as a critical link to relevant USAID/Washington Bureaus and Offices and the Agency's central CLA Team in both seeking and sharing promising practices in CLA worldwide.   Key to this position will be revitalizing and fostering an environment that advances learning among USAID staff, implementing partners and other stakeholders. In conjunction with the Program Office M&E Specialist, technical office M&E focal points, the Mission Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Working Group, and Mission’s MEL Contractor, the incumbent identifies ways to reduce knowledge sharing barriers (e.g., through application of e-sharing and learning tools, such as outcome mapping, social network analyses, creation of Communities of Practice and USAID’s Council of Advisors) and move staff from their current ‘activity focused’ orientation to more holistic project and program management approaches, including  peer and cross-office learning interactions.   As many of the duties of the Senior Learning Advisor involve an organizational behavior-change requirement, the Advisor must have the necessary professional credibility and gravitas to effectively identify the need for change, ability to articulate that knowledge to a non-expert audience, and provide persuasive arguments that will motivate Mission staff to accept and enact the changes.   The Senior Learning Advisor will advance CLA in USAID/Ethiopia through a wide range of resources, platforms and practices used by USAID staff, implementation and development partners to promote adaptive, organizational learning and evaluation. These include: learning agendas, formal evaluations and studies, feedback loops for information sharing and dissemination, forums and engagements that enable open exchanges of ideas, and adaptive management strategies that translate learning into action. While USAID/Ethiopia is committed to broadly strengthening monitoring and evaluation practices as part of its CLA approach and evidence-based decision making, traditionally defined “M&E” should be understood as only a subset of USAID/Ethiopia’s broader understanding and application of CLA and organizational learning and improved effectiveness.   2.      Statement of Duties to be Performed   The central function of the Program Office in monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) is to ensure that the causal pathway to desired development outcomes is continuously assessed and adjusted, through analysis of a variety of information sources and knowledge, to yield the most effective course of action. Building on this, the Senior Learning Advisor will help institutionalize CLA across the Mission, including in strategy and program implementation.   More specifically, s/he will facilitate Mission efforts to develop utilization-focused learning agendas, feed new learning information into strategy, projects, and activities at all points in the program cycle, and develop innovative approaches to supporting program adaptation. The incumbent will also build the capacity of Mission staff, guiding leadership and technical offices to translate new learning, as well as information about changing conditions, into iterative strategic and programmatic adjustments. The quality of the guidance provided by the Senior Learning Advisor and their ability to institutionalize CLA practices in the Mission will, to a large-extent, determine the cost-effectiveness of key U.S. Government (USG) development investments in Ethiopia.   While the Mission-wide MEL contract will provide CLA coordination support by planning and staging organizational reflection and learning opportunities, this position will coordinate with M&E specialists at the Mission, liaise with the MEL contractor, external stakeholders and technical teams to foster learning and adaptation and representing the Program Office in discussions and negotiations with implementing partners (IP).   Major Roles and Responsibilities 1.      Develop, Manage and Coordinate Mission Organizational and Program Learning Opportunities - (50%) ?       Lead the Mission in the development of a cohesive learning agenda, consistent with its Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS). ?       Build the capacity of Mission staff to fully grasp the core concepts of CLA and directly apply them to Mission programming. ?       Support the Mission’s decision-making on organizational interventions to advance and integrate CLA best practices across the Mission’s portfolio. ?       Support Mission staff with the development of internal partnerships and play a leading role in the thought leadership surrounding collaboration and the organization of  cross-functional teams. ?       Develop innovative and user-friendly approaches that maximize Mission use of data to improve programming. ?       Cultivate a body of knowledge that can be disseminated to share with internal and external actors on best practices. ?       Advise Mission Leadership and provide on-going feedback on how new processes are working to enable Mission leadership to course correct along the way and improve CLA practices within the Mission and with partners and stakeholders, with a goal toward improving program outcomes. ?       Guide technical teams’ utilization of research design and methodologies, applied research studies, impact assessments, capturing and sharing new knowledge, engaging stakeholders in CLA, and applying learning to ongoing program and project/activity design and management. Develop interactive learning opportunities that inform subsequent work plans, activity designs, target setting, assessments, studies and potential adjustments in project/activity implementation. ?       Support technical offices with executing their CLA priorities, including linking technical offices to external support or mechanisms and/or developing scopes of work for supplementary support. ?       Seek opportunities to advance USAID’s knowledge management and learning activities, ensuring effective sharing and applied learning in topics of strategic interest to USAID/Ethiopia (e.g., methods to integrate effective, responsible governance in non-Democracy and Governance focused programming; strategies to increase women’s influence in households, nutrition and agriculture; and, private-sector led approaches to social services and development). ?       Support Program Office backstops/cross-cutting specialists and working groups to ensure a focus on the principles, fundamentals and best practices of CLA within in support of iterative course corrections and ensure ongoing and evolving alignment of portfolio with strategy. ?       Support the Executive Office in fostering and advancing USAID/Ethiopia's organizational culture, orienting new staff on the Mission Leadership Charter and Mission values and behavioral expectations, while encouraging ongoing organizational development.   2.      Lead stakeholder engagement and build partnerships (25%) ?       More specific to the external side of collaboration, the incumbent will lead the Mission’s exploration and building of partnerships that can maximize the Mission’s programming impact. ?       Play a lead role in the coordination and implementation of events related to engaging Implementing Partners. For example, the Program Office hosts quarterly Implementing Partner meetings, as well as cross-cutting workshops (such as gender and youth). The incumbent will play a lead role in coordinating the planning of this event, incorporating CLA as a backdrop to meeting agendas and ensuring regular follow up and continuous refinement to these public relations events.   3.      Knowledge Management - (25%) ?       To enable program adaptation, Mission staff must have highly user-friendly access to useful information and knowledge. Often, organizations can generate so much information that the average activity manager may not know how to translate findings into practical steps to adjust programming. The incumbent will make recommendations on best-fit MEL practices and on generating data needs in relation to the Mission’s unique portfolio. ?       Often, data users may not know where to look for information as it takes real effort to gather data from across the Mission and turn it into something useable. The incumbent will oversee the development of a highly user-friendly KM system and will coordinate closely with MEL and KM specialists to establish methods to continuously generate useful data as inputs and establish either new systems and/or consolidate or reduce separate yet duplicative tools that are already in existence. ?       Engage a wide range of internal and external stakeholders to facilitate the transfer and exchange of knowledge among peers. To be successful, the incumbent must work to “download” information from people and activities so that the Mission can maintain this knowledge, as opposed to losing it when a colleague departs or an activity concludes.   ?       Use expert knowledge to build capacity among Mission staff on key knowledge management principles and learning.   3.      Supervisory Relationship   The Senior Learning Advisor works under the supervision of the Supervisory Program Officer, or designate, but also provides direct advice and guidance to the Mission Director and Senior Management Team. S/he is considered an expert in this field. As such, they will be delegated responsibility and authority to plan, schedule, and carry out major CLA-oriented activities concerned with the analysis and evaluation of programs and organizational learning. Analyses, evaluations, and recommendations developed by the incumbent will be accepted by senior management to influence the broader USAID strategy and results expected. The supervisor provides a high-level review of the assignment, the goals and objectives to be achieved, and the results expected. The Senior Learning Advisor will work with minimal guidelines and supervision, but will also coordinate with team members and ensure work products are integrated with other major office deliverables. S/he is also required to determine assignments that must be coordinated with the supervisor and/or senior management and will seek advice and assistance, as required.    4.      Supervisory Controls:   The incumbent will be expected to lead USAID’s CLA working group(s), offer  technical guidance and professional coaching to Mission staff in practices and techniques for cultivating organizational learning about USAID’s development hypotheses, results, and capacities to conduct special studies, learning reviews and/or evaluations. The incumbent will be an integral member of the Mission Management Team and will have frequent and direct contact with Mission leadership. The incumbent may provide oversight and/or supervision of staff on temporary assignments or TDYs to Ethiopia related to CLA.   Exercise of Judgment: The incumbent works with a high level of independence in advancing USAID’s CLA agenda. S/he uses considerable judgment in developing ideas and proposals as well as determining who to involve in a particular activity, and leads teams to accomplish the objectives and analyses agreed to.   2.               AREA OF CONSIDERATION:     For USPSC: ·         Be a U.S. citizen or U.S. Permanent Resident (“green card holder”); ·         U.S. resident alien means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States; ·         Submit a complete application as outlined in the solicitation section titled APPLYING; ·         Be able to obtain facility access authorization; ·         Be able to obtain a Department of State medical clearance; ·         Be willing to travel to work sites and other offices as/when requested; ·         Employment is subject to funds availability and all the required approvals obtained.   3.         PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The work requested does not involve undue physical demands.   4.               POINT OF CONTACT: Supervisory Executive Officer, Shelby Hunt and HR Specialist, Fekadu Tamirate at addisusaidjobs@usaid.gov.   Note: No in-person appointments or telephone calls will be entertained, unless you are required to have more information about this solicitation.     II.             MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR THIS POSITION   Applications will be initially screened by the Human Resources Office to determine whether applicants have met the advertised minimum qualifications.

In particular, please consider in your review the following: 1. Given pre-primary teachers are still trained in ""normal schools"", is support to these institutions (or their governing bodies) a strategic approach or should USAID focus on advocating that all teachers should be trained at the university level and continue strengthening teacher training at that level? 2. The new USG International Basic Education Strategy and USAID Education Policy discuss strengthening non-state education institutions as a opportunity to expand access to quality education. Can USAID integrate support for non-state schools in ways that are not currently addressed in this SOW? Page 2 of 2 3. Implementation of the new national workforce development system will require contributions and interaction from many entities. What should USAID prioritize in support of this new system? Are there ways the system can better integrate support to returned migrants? 4. Given USAID expects these activities will be accomplished with external partners, are there other ways to integrate private sector engagement not currently addressed in the SOW? Are there specific private sector entities that USAID should work with under each objective which are not currently indicated in the SOW? To assist in the efficiency of this process please ensure that comments are concise and specific to information included within the draft SOW; and submitted comments make specific reference to page and section numbers.

The United States Government represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) issues a request for information for agency correspondence tracking systems. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information on industry capabilities related to correspondence management and tracking. In an environment where the government is required to engage with key stakeholders digitally and/or electronically, USAID needs a correspondence management and tracking solution (this could be in the form of a service, IT software, etc.) that will support existing and future electronic services. Our goal is to create the capability for our agency to automatically accept solicited and/or unsolicited correspondence and documentation, sort and categorize it, and then notify the appropriate processing area(s) and individuals of the receipt of the documentation for their feedback and approval.  USAID currently receives various types of digital documents and various forms and correspondence in paper format. The objective is to further streamline the intake and triaging process and to reduce the overall dependency on paper. The purpose of this tool would be to provide a solution that allows us to route incoming documents, improve the document capture process and provide methods to facilitate the receiving, identifying, categorizing, indexing, routing, and storing steps in the process to make the document available for viewing and available for processing by multiple business lines and business owners. This solution will be the underlying document repository, responsible for managing the lifecycle of the submission for storage, retention and archive and disposition according to federal laws and mandates. The solicited tool would replace an existing tool used to track correspondence electronically on behalf of USAID leadership and provide a computerized database for ready access by authorized personnel to respond to inquiries about controlled correspondence. It would also collect and organize information on reports required of the Agency in Congressional legislation and other directives. As part of market research, the Office of the Executive Secretariat is issuing this RFI to ascertain a better understanding of qualified and interested GSA schedule contractors who may be capable of providing the requested support, as further described below, as well as the estimated cost of such support.  The Government may use the responses to this RFI for information and planning purposes.   Responses to this RFI are not quotes on which USAID can issue any schedule orders. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not itself constitute a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  The Government does not intend to award a schedule order(s) based only on responses to this request for information.  All information received in response to this RFI marked “proprietary” will be protected and handled accordingly.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  Responders are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue an RFQ, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI. Responses to this RFI must include the following: Capability Statement of the Offeror (details below draft SOO) Estimated Cost and Pricing from the Offeror Limited responses to 5 pages   Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) Background: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks a tool that provides electronic correspondence tracking and reporting. Objectives: The solution(s) should include capabilities to track, store and report on correspondence between USAID, the Office of Administrator, and other agencies. Requirements for each capability are discussed in detail below. The solution should accommodate at least 50 simultaneous users. The solution should be cloud based. The solution should be FedRamp approved or show that it is “FedRamp Ready” and comply with all federal statutory and policy requirements, including FISMA and ATO requirements. If the solution is not FedRamp Ready, USAID is interested to know if there is a potential time frame and path to future compliance. If solution is cloud based, it should have some way to prevent the execution of malicious payloads from within submitted data sets. Solution should have robust administrative capabilities and should allow for the management of: Correspondence Multiple file types to be edited in the tool Tracking Of all correspondence within the system Administrative capabilities: The solution's administrative capabilities should allow for the management of program functions and performance by local administrators. Local administrators should have the ability to assign or deny access to cases to licensed users. Administrative rights should be allowed to be based on user, roles, and groups. User and administrators operations should be able to be audited.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT A. Background Over the past decade, Ethiopia has maintained one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the world, and its poverty rate has decreased from 44 percent in 2000 to 23.5 percent in 2016. The Government of Ethiopia (GOE) is a strong regional security partner in combating terrorist threats, contributing peacekeeping troops, and hosting the continent's second largest refugee population. However, Ethiopia, one of the most populous landlocked countries in the world, with an estimated 102 million people, remains beset by severe challenges that threaten its development gains. Chronic malnutrition, extreme poverty, a restless, youth bulge, rapidly expanding urban centers, increasingly limited space for political expression and association, civil and political conflict and intensifying droughts all strain the GOE's ability to provide for its citizens. Recently, the government appointed a new prime minister and several new ministers and is sending strong signals in response to citizen concerns for a more transparent and responsive system. With a portfolio worth approximately $2 billion and more than 100 on-going activities, USAID/Ethiopia implements one of the US Government's (USG) largest and most complex development and humanitarian assistance programs. USAID/Ethiopia's interventions work to save lives, build resilient systems, and maintain a focus on supporting Ethiopia's long-term goal of a more self-reliant, prosperous and democratic society. Ethiopia's FY 2017 budget is $892 million, including $584 million in humanitarian assistance, and contributes to five Presidential initiatives - Feed the Future, Power Africa, the Global Health Initiative, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, and the Presidential Malaria Initiative. As a high profile country USAID supports the embassy with numerous official visitors, including delegations in 2017 headed by the USAID Administrator and numerous members of Congress. USAID Ethiopia's staff includes 217 positions: 43 U.S. Direct Hires (USDH), 24 U.S. Personal Service Contractors (USPSC), 2 Third Country National PSCs and 148 Foreign Service Nationals (FSN). The Mission also provides comprehensive regional support to USAID's office in Djibouti, which has a program portfolio worth $33 million and 2 USDH, 1 USPSC, and 12 FSN staff members. USAID/Ethiopia is a pilot Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) country for the Agency with the intent of providing lessons learned on how to develop a strategy that places a country on a path toward self-reliance. Preliminary thinking on the draft CDCS identifies a goal whereby Ethiopia will become more prosperous, inclusive and self-reliant, with empowered citizens driving effective and accountable governance, poverty reduction, and improved crises management. This would be targeted by achieving development objectives that seek to: (1) reduce risk and impact of disasters; (2) increase resilience of vulnerable populations to key shocks; (3) improve broad-based, inclusive economic growth; and, (4) advance health and education outcomes through effective and gender equitable systems. B. ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION: Based in USAID/Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, the Program Officer (PO) serves in the Program Office for USAID/Ethiopia, and reports to the Supervisory Program Officer. The Program Office has a staff of 3 USDHs, 10 FSNs and a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Fellow. The PO may supervise up to five FSNs, including program budget and monitoring, evaluation and learning staff, but would be expected to flexibly provide leadership and assistance across other Program Office and mission teams as needed. The Program Office also provides support to the USAID Office in Djibouti for all program office functions; and manages a 4-year, $15 million monitoring, evaluation and learning contract that provides services to the Ethiopia mission. The PO has a very good understanding of USAID business practices and procedures, and leads the mission ensuring effective implementation of the Program Cycle--USAID's policy for planning, delivering, assessing, and adapting development programming--across the Mission's $2 billion program portfolio. This includes facilitating cross-team collaboration to ensure that multiple perspectives are brought to planning and design processes, and that all relevant actors fulfill their implementation, management, and reporting responsibilities. As outlined more generally in the USAID Automated Directive System 201 series, the PO is expected to take a prominent role ensuring the following principles which serve as the foundation for the successful implementation of the Program Cycle are effectively applied: A. Analytic Rigor to Support Evidence-based Decision-Making B. Manage Adaptively through Continuous Learning C. Promote Sustainability through Local Ownership D. Utilize a Range of Approaches to Achieve Results. This high-level professional position requires advanced, hands-on state-of-the-art knowledge, well developed interpersonal and managerial skills, and sound judgment. The PO exercises a high degree of personal initiative, and must set and meet deadlines in a complex organizational structure. The PO advises the Supervisory Program Officer on strategic and management issues, and helps formulate mission policy. The PO maintains and cultivates effective external relations with officials in the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), especially with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation (MOFEC), other international donors, and key Washington and Embassy interagency stakeholders. The PO also helps lead the Mission in building the organizational capacity of mission staff to enhance teamwork and create a ""Mission of Leaders"". The PO advises the Supervisory Program Officer on the strategic and management direction for the USAID/Ethiopia and Djibouti country programs. More specifically, the PO advises on Mission policy related to implementing Program Cycle processes; and provides leadership for development of the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), budget planning and implementation, program reporting, public information, donor coordination, and monitoring and evaluation. The PO may be responsible for a host of program office-related functions such as collaborating with technical offices to coordinate the review of concept papers, Project Appraisal and Project Authorization Documents, new activity designs, amendments, related statements of work, and other functions as needed. The PO takes a leading role in drafting and/or revising components of USAID/Ethiopia's CDCS and other programmatic documents, as necessary. The PO must have demonstrated the ability to exercise significant, independent professional judgment to anticipate and address both systemic and ad hoc challenges related to program and activity design, budgeting, and Program Office operations. The position requires an entrepreneurial, results-oriented approach to delivering development assistance; a customer service-oriented approach to serving broad Mission needs; and the ability to diplomatically and tactfully confront and resolve bureaucratic institutional and interagency challenges, while maintaining collaborative relations. Strong interpersonal skills are required in order to establish and maintain these collaborative relations with counterparts, both inside and outside of USAID. The Mission is seeking a self-starter who will be responsive to client needs, has the ability to work calmly and effectively under pressure, and can be easily integrated into the existing management team. 2. Statement of Duties to be performed Specific responsibilities will include but are not limited to the following: ? Foster a mission-wide environment that promotes learning and adapting and champions leadership behaviors. ? Apply strong knowledge of U.S. Government and USAID policies, regulations and procedures to the development and management of USAID/Ethiopia programs based on a comprehensive understanding of U.S., national and regional development needs and objectives. ? Cultivate and maintain strong collaborative relations with key external stakeholders within the interagency, other donors and the GOE, especially with MOFEC. ? Help lead program planning -- including the design, development, documentation, and amending (as needed) of the Mission's CDCS, Performance Management Plan, and new projects, and coordinate related approval processes. Coordinate and recommend to the Supervisory Program Officer and Mission Management on program budget resource requests and ensure alignment with strategic priorities. ? Direct the development and preparation of Mission reports, budgets and Congressional presentation material for submission to, and approval by, USAID/Washington, including the annual Operational Plan (OP), Congressional Budget Justification, Performance Plan and Report (PPR), and Congressional Notifications (CN). ? Monitor, analyze and evaluate the implementation, results, and accomplishments of projects and activities to assess their effectiveness, efficiency, and significance. Provide leadership for the design and development of the Mission's knowledge management and performance monitoring systems. Ensure lessons learned are used to adapt programming in a timely manner. ? Lead the Mission in enterprise risk management to help staff make informed decisions on how best to deliver foreign assistance. ? Mentor and coach junior officers. Provide direct feedback (both positive and negative) to staff on a regular basis to improve individual and team performance. ? Make site visits as necessary to observe program results and to interface with project implementation partners. ? Flexibly support the Program Office and Mission through a variety of other assigned tasks. Responds to urgent, complex information requests and action items as needed. 3.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES: BACKGROUND The USAID Mission in Kosovo was opened in July 1999 and much of the focus was on preparing Kosovo for independence and establishing basic institutions necessary for a democracy to function. During this period, Kosovo was established as an internationally administered region, administered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Since 1999, over $1.2 billion in U.S. assistance was committed to the reconstruction of Kosovo and to building self-governing institutions and a viable economy. In February 2008, Kosovo declared independence. The creation of Europe's newest state has proceeded on a forward path despite setbacks. Starting from virtually zero, Kosovo today is a functioning state, with a functioning government and a society that is growing stronger and more self-confident. The handover process of Kosovo's nascent institutions from UN control to the new Government of Kosovo (GOK) has highlighted the young state's growing maturity and capacity. USAID/Kosovo is the largest Mission in the Balkan region and the second largest donor in Kosovo after the European Union (EU), with an active portfolio valued at over $225 million. USAID/Kosovo has 97 positions (16 U. S. Direct Hires (USDH), 6 Personal Services Contractors (PSC), and 75 Cooperating Country Nationals (CCNs) in seven offices.

SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Secret 9. STATEMENT OF DUTIES: BACKGROUND The USAID Mission in Kosovo was opened in July 1999 and much of the focus was on preparing Kosovo for independence and establishing basic institutions necessary for a democracy to function. During this period, Kosovo was established as an internationally administered region, administered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Since 1999, over $1.2 billion in U.S. assistance was committed to the reconstruction of Kosovo and to building self-governing institutions and a viable economy. In February 2008, Kosovo declared independence. The creation of Europe's newest state has proceeded on a forward path despite setbacks. Starting from virtually zero, Kosovo today is a functioning state, with a functioning government and a society that is growing stronger and more self-confident. The handover process of Kosovo's nascent institutions from UN control to the new Government of Kosovo (GOK) has highlighted the young state's growing maturity and capacity. USAID/Kosovo is presently a medium-sized Mission with 97 staff positions (16 USDHs, 6 USPSCs, and 75 CCNs). The Mission manages an active portfolio valued at approximately $225 million. The Mission is currently undertaking several major activities in which the Program and Policy Office is leading or integrally involved. USAID/Kosovo's Program and Policy Office (PPO) is responsible for coordinating the Mission's overall program, providing leadership in strategy development, supporting technical offices in program and budget operations, monitoring and evaluation and reporting of results, and directing outreach efforts. The Mission requires the services of a Senior Program Office Advisor (SPOA) with extensive and in-depth experience in international development, demonstrated management and leadership skills, and senior-level expertise in all areas related to the work of the Program Office. This includes strategy development, project design and development, performance monitoring and evaluation, the Federal Budget process (including budget planning, management and reporting) and outreach and communications. The individual will provide technical and programmatic support in all areas. The Advisor will also provide direct support for drafting the sections of Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) related to USAID's assistance and addendum to the CDCS documenting all approved changes to the strategy and other special initiatives that may arise.

"72067318R00003","Senior Continuum of Care HIV/AIDS Advisor","Namibia is a priority country that continues to receive PEPFAR resources.  USAID/Namibia is heavily engaged in planning and implementing a full range of HIV/AIDS programs, including prevention, TB/HIV prevention, treatment and care programs, including orphan and vulnerable children (OVC).  In FY 2017, the value of the USAID HIV/AIDS and Health Office’s portfolio was approximately $30 million - almost half of all PEPFAR resources in Namibia.  The USAID/Namibia Health Office has grown rapidly from 10 staff in 2015 to 20 staff in 2017; the Office collaborates closely with other United States Government (USG) agencies to implement the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), especially the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health Office staff are active participants in PEPFAR policy and program design, and often chair interagency technical working groups on a range of health-related issues. PEPFAR Namibia is oriented toward strategic partnership with all levels of the Government of the Republic of Namibia (GRN), with an emphasis on epidemic control, health systems strengthening, and cost efficiencies for a sustainable HIV response. The Government of Namibia is the custodian of the national HIV response and PEPFAR is the key partner in the goal of an AIDS-free generation.  Enhancing the availability, quality, and use of prevention and treatment services along the HIV Continuum of Care is the priority for Namibia in order to achieve epidemic control.  The Continuum of Care Team Leader and Advisor plays a critical, cross-cutting role that affects not only the direction and progress of USAID in Namibia and the PEPFAR program.","Jun 10, 2018 07:00 PM EDT","May 11, 2018","May 11, 2018","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Caroline S.

(ACE) Project. The overall goal of the Project is to increase global competitiveness as well as private sector-led economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza through providing problem-solving services to Palestinian firms in order to enable them to expand sales and exports and generate increased investment. These increases will result in the creation of new jobs, which will increase the incomes of people currently unemployed or underemployed, including women and youth, contributing thereby to a growing, inclusive economy. The anticipated Project will apply a market-driven approach starting with the market â€“ operationally, buyers â€“ and work backwards to help firms solve the constraints that stand in the way of their selling more and increasing sales and profitability. The Project consists of two primary components as follows: 1. Component I will focus on transactional support where the Contractorâ€™s technical assistance will help firms take the actions required to address the client firmsâ€™ business problems with business solutions and ultimately increase sales, exports, investment, productivity, and jobs. 2. Component II will work with firms as well as private sector growth-focused entities, such as trade and business organizations or government institutions, to focus on removing systemic constraints (policy or institutional) that prevent sales transactions from taking place. Prospective Offerors are advised that issuance of the RFP solicitation and award of a contract are subject to the availability of funds, as certain procedural and legislative requirements for obligating funds have not yet been met.

General Statement of Purpose of the Contract A. Background of the Project As a member of USAID/Ethiopia's Assets and Livelihoods Transition Office (ALT), the incumbent will serve as the Food Security Coordinator (FSC) to the Mission. The FSC will coordinate USAID programs supporting the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE)'s programs in food security and ensure that USAID activities support the Mission's strategic development objectives and the overall Mission strategy, the Global Food Security Strategy, the Feed the Future Initiative, and USAID objectives in Ethiopia to build the resilience of vulnerable populations. The FSC will be the primary point of contact for food security matters on the ALT team, serve as the Food Security Team Leader, and will represent USAID/Ethiopia in broader donor and government fora covering food security issues, with a particular focus on, but not limited to, the Productive Safety Net Program (PNSP). Safety Net and Food Security Programming in Ethiopia USAID has supported the evolution of the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) since its beginning in 2005. Currently in its fourth phase - PSNP4 - the safety net is implemented by the Government pooling resources from 11 donors and development partners along with an increasing amount of resources from the Ethiopian government. The PSNP provides regular cash or food transfers to 8 million chronically food insecure people across Ethiopia. The food/cash-for-work component supports public works programs related to landscape restoration, irrigation, and agro-forestry. The PSNP has demonstrated that safety nets - when provided in a predictable, regular manner - can protect households from the negative impacts of shocks.   The objective of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP4) is: Resilience to shocks and livelihoods enhanced and food security and nutrition improved for rural households vulnerable to food insecurity. Originally, the PSNP was not designed to graduate households on its own. In addition to a safety net that smooths consumption and prevents backsliding, other measures are also needed to help people build their assets and escape from poverty. Previously, these other measures were provided through the Government's Household Asset Building program (HABP). With strong USAID advocacy to improve coordination and link livelihoods support more directly to PSNP beneficiaries, this livelihoods support work is now supported under the Livelihoods Component of PSNP4 which includes three livelihoods pathways: on-farm, off-farm and employment. USAID livelihoods investments are aligned with these efforts. In 2017 PSNP4 underwent a reform under the Rural Productive Safety Net Program that addressed gaps in financing for PSNP4 and set out an agenda to improve and achieve a more predictable safety net system seeking to better integrate PSNP and humanitarian assistance programing under a common operational framework to better manage the selection, administration, and payments to beneficiaries. B. Organizational Location of Position: The position title is the Food Security Coordinator (FSC). The FSC will be a part of the USAID/Ethiopia's ALT team and will work with all appropriate Mission development objectives (DO) teams to better serve vulnerable food insecure populations with food security and resilience oriented strategies and programming. The FSC will contribute to related crosscutting activities such as nutrition, gender, and youth. Within ALT, across USAID, and in conjunction with USAID implementing partners and other partners such as other donors and the Government of Ethiopia, the FSC will support ALT's agenda for Collaboration, Learning and Adapting. The FSC will directly support senior Mission management as well as relevant offices in the Embassy in formulating and articulating appropriate food security strategy policy and activities to address vulnerability among the chronically food insecure, including the coordination of USAID's support to the PSNP and support for an improved continuum of response across safety net and humanitarian beneficiaries. The FSC will contribute to the Mission's work under the U.S. Global Food Security Strategy for Ethiopia; including Feed the Future and Food for Peace Title II supported programming targeted at chronically food insecure populations. The FSC will have an important role in supporting the operationalization of the PSNP4 livelihoods component of PSNP4 supported by USAID and other donors in collaboration with the Food Security Coordination Directorate at the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. 2.

USAID invites organizations and companies to submit an Expression of Interest, as provided below. The intent of the BAA is to allow co-creation and co-design to the maximum extent to create high quality, effective partnerships with great efficiency in time and resources.

Co-Investing: USAID wants to align goals with the partners under this BAA, to facilitate shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing. Shared resourcing requires that cash and other resources, both tangible and intangible, such as in-kind contributions, expertise, intellectual property, brand value, high-value coordination, and access to key people, places, and information, are directed towards reaching the solution to the Problem/Challenge. Co-investing does not require equal shared resources (such as 1:1 leverage), but rather resource contributions that are appropriate to the specific project's objectives, considering the comparative advantages brought by the participation of each party.","Mar 19, 2018 12:00 PM EDT","Feb 22, 2018","Feb 22, 2018","Special Notice","ARMANDO ESPINOSA","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT","N/A","N/A"

The overall goal of the program is to reduce the burden of trade-related restrictions, transaction costs, and policy and institutional weaknesses, including those associated with movement and access, that undermine private sector competitiveness, discourage job creation, contribute to unsustainable trade and fiscal deficits, and threaten the foundations of macroeconomic stability in WBG, a crucial underlying driver of economic growth. The anticipated project will be divided into three components. Component 1 will work flexibly with the Palestinian Authority (PA), Government of Israel (GOI), the private sector, and civil society partners to reduce barriers to trade, movement, and access by improving trade logistics and building the capacity of Palestinian trade-related institutions. Component 2 will work selectively to identify and ease policy and institutional constraints to the business and investment enabling environment. Finally, Component 3 will support targeted fiscal policy and administration initiatives to help contain fiscal leakages, improve revenue performance, enhance fiscal sustainability and better manage macroeconomic risks.

"72065418R00001","Senior Malaria Advisor - Luanda, Angola","Senior Malaria Advisor - Luanda, Angola Under the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), USAID/Angola partners with the Angolan Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve the health status of Angolans through improvements to the quality of service delivery and health systems strengthening activities. The USAID/Angola budget in FY14 totaled approximately $41 million for health activities in malaria, HIV/AIDS, family planning/reproductive health and polio. There is an opportunity to improve synergies among USAID-funded interventions and develop and implement robust integrated health services delivery and health systems strengthening programs. To expand access to health services and address systemic issues, USAID's program addresses issues related to human resource management, health finance, commodity procurement and distribution and integrated delivery of high quality services in targeted health facilities. USAID also works with corporations to expand and improve their workplace health programs and with civil society organizations involved in health care to improve their technical and management skills. USAID partners with the MOH to improve their ability to improve the well-being of Angolans through the delivery of better quality, more reliable health services. Technical assistance focuses on areas such as pharmaceutical logistics, improved human resources and supervisory systems, data management related to program planning, monitoring and budgeting. To increase transparency and responsiveness to local needs, the program also fosters improved communications and relationships between local health staff and the communities they serve. As such, USAID is working with the MOH to develop systems at the national level that are informed by inputs from targeted provinces and municipalities. Significant progress has been made in the fight against malaria in Angola, and data from the 2011 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) show an almost 40% decline in parasitemia among children under five years of age from the 2006/7 MIS (from 21% to 13.5%). According to the 2011 MIS, the mortality rate for children under five years of age has fallen by 23% over the last five years, and it is currently estimated at 91 deaths per 1,000 live births. Nonetheless, malaria continues to be a major health problem and is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in Angola. Malaria accounts for 35% of curative care demand, 35% of mortality in children, 40% of pre-natal mortality, 25% of maternal morbidity, and causes 60% of hospital admissions in children under five years of age and 10% of admissions of pregnant women (Plan National de Développement Sanitaire (PNDS) 2013, annex 4). Furthermore, malaria is a leading cause of low birth weight, and anemia due to malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both children and pregnant women. Angola was selected as one of three countries to receive funding during the first year of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and has been implementing a significant malaria program for multiple years. The objective of this initiative is to assist African countries, in collaboration with other partners, to rapidly scale up coverage of vulnerable groups with four highly effective interventions: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria in pregnancy, insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), and indoor spraying with residual insecticides (IRS).","Dec 02, 2017 06:00 PM EST","Nov 3, 2017","Nov 3, 2017","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Vernette Duvenhage","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","SUPPORT SVCS (PROF, ADMIN, MGMT)","N/A","N/A"

Chemonics will deliver the services by the end date of the existing contract: November 24, 2018. The original contract period of performance will not change. Chemonics International has developed a successful program delivering climate adaptation services in Mozambique under existing contract AID-656-C-14-00001.

"SOL-633-17-000002","HIV Prevention Advisor","Botswana is among the most affected countries in the world, with a national adult HIV prevalence of 23.8% and approximately 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in a country of 1.88 million. Botswana, as one of the former 15 focus countries under PEPFAR, has a strong USG presence in HIV/AIDS. USAID has a field office in Gaborone that manages activities in the areas of trade and economic growth, and environment; however, until recently USAID did not have a presence to support its HIV/AIDS activities which were managed from the Regional HIV/AIDS Program Office [RHAP] in Pretoria. In 2007, USAID hired a Director to provide technical and programmatic oversight to the USAID activities in Botswana as the first step in providing appropriate in-country support for this portfolio which has been growing in size and complexity. This position will support the USAID Director in providing oversight and support for USAID/Botswana’s HIV prevention activities and coordination with other USG partners (State Department, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Defense and Peace Corps) and collaboration with the Government of Botswana and other bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors. Specifically, USAID is supporting prevention efforts in the areas of behavior change communication, HIV testing and counseling, capacity building, male circumcision, alcohol, and gender as well as prevention for People Living with HIV/AIDS. These activities will target the general population as well as most-at-risk populations. A combination package for prevention is employed in Botswana. This is a set of interventions which, if implemented simultaneously with sufficient reach, intensity, and duration, has the potential to dramatically reduce further transmission of HIV in Botswana. The Government of Botswana (GOB) has made a commitment to achieving the goal of “Zero New Infections by 2016” and the Prevention Advisor will be charged with assisting the GOB in reaching the goals set out in the “National Operational Plan for Scaling up HIV Prevention in Botswana”.  The HIV Prevention Advisor, who will be based in Gaborone, Botswana, is recruited, hired, and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional HIV-AIDS Program (RHAP) for Southern Africa (which is based in Pretoria, South Africa) through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan). Supervision of this position is assigned to the USAID Director in Botswana, and the incumbent will be a key player on the inter-Agency PEPFAR team.  ","Jun 16, 2017 07:00 PM EDT","May 16, 2017","May 16, 2017","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Caroline S.

PEPFAR investments also help alleviate suffering from other diseases across the global health spectrum. PEPFAR is driven by a shared responsibility among donor and partner nations and others to make smart investments to save lives. Thanks in large part to U.S. leadership, tremendous progress has been made in the fight against global AIDS. PEPFAR has supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 7 million men, women and children worldwide as of September 30, 2013. PEPFAR supported HIV testing and counseling for more than 74.3 million people in FY 2016, providing a critical entry point to prevention, treatment, and care. In addition, life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART) for nearly 11.5 million adults and 1.1 million children, were provided through PEPFAR assistance in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. PEPFAR provided antiretroviral medications to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the virus. Due to this PEPFAR support, nearly 2 million babies were born HIV-free. By September 30, 2016, PEPFAR had also supported more than 11.7 million voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) procedures in east and southern Africa. Now in its third phase, PEPFAR is continuing to focus on the transition from an emergency response to building sustainable programs. These programs are country-owned and country-driven and address HIV/AIDS with a broader context of health and development. PEPFAR's program builds on past strengths and increases efficiencies by scaling up effective interventions and ensuring value.","May 06, 2017 07:00 PM EDT","Apr 10, 2017","Apr 10, 2017","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Caroline Sello","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","SUPPORT SVCS (PROF, ADMIN, MGMT)","N/A","N/A"

THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUREAU FOR ASIA BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) NO. BAA-OAA-RM-2017 HARNESSING LOCAL INNOVATIONS, EXPERTISE, AND PARTNERSHIP TO SOLVE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN ASIA ADDENDUM 01 - IMPROVING URBAN HEALTH IN ASIA I. BACKGROUND A. Overview Achieving meaningful health outcomes in the growing number of urban centers of Asia requires an accurate understanding of the outcomes that matter to all segments of the urban population. This cannot be achieved without leadership and investment from local government institutions, civil society organizations and the private sector, nor can these outcomes be sustained over the long term without this local buy-in. Urban health, in particular, also requires collaboration far beyond the health sector to achieve lasting health and well-being. Asia's dynamism and development trajectory demands a shift in thinking beyond traditional development programming. Change agents-ranging from conventional thinkers to disruptive innovators-abound in Asia, providing partnership opportunities that can speed the development curve for health. We seek to partner with these change agents to catalyze new ways to solve problems in urban health. B. Problem Statement With approximately half of the world's population living in Asia, mixed health systems are grappling with the shifting demographics of a rapidly aging population and overwhelmed with responding to the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Urbanization further complicates health systems' ability to address these shifting health challenges. Home to 53 per cent of the world's urban population , Asia's urban growth continues to mushroom. In 2015, Asia's urban areas housed 2.11 billion people and are expected to further expand by 2020. While urbanization offers opportunities for economic growth as well as for the provision of better health and social services to the majority, it also creates a new range of challenges including growing inequalities between the well-off and the urban poor, particularly those living in slums who constitute more than one third of the urban population in Asia. Rural-to-urban migration and natural population growth is rapidly increasing both city size and urban population size, impacting public health in complex, intertwined ways. The design of physical spaces and the built environment itself has impacts on personal health. Environmental quality in urban areas-air pollution, inadequate water and sanitation, substandard waste removal, poor construction and ventilation, chemical biohazards-also increase the spread of disease, communicable and non-communicable alike. The increased mobility between cities and rural areas, as well as overcrowding in many urban populations creates pathways for new sets of health challenges. In addition to migration from rural areas to very large cities that tend to capture most of the migratory flux, a new urban environment is being created with a rapid transformation of rural or peri-urban zones into second tier cities, which creates additional unique challenges. Such massive migration and uncontrolled population growth not only challenges health systems, but exacerbates inequities for healthcare delivery, especially among highly mobile or undocumented urban poor. Increasingly, urban slums are seeing the convergence of communicable and non-communicable diseases : Infectious diseases are widespread in urban slum settlements , while NCDs disproportionately affect low socioeconomic groups that have the least access to and ability to utilize health care services and often are not protected by existing healthcare schemes, policies, and regulations. With urbanization as an underlying risk factor for NCDs, the urban poor are therefore caught in a cycle of poverty and poor health. Several proximal and distal determinants, including employment/unemployment, workplace practices, race, ethnicity, gender and socio-economic status play a large role in determining access to quality healthcare in urban environments as well as habitat, urban infrastructures, security, waste management, and access to water and sanitation. These factors can be deeply rooted, vary greatly within a particular city, and play a large role in determining access to social services as well as the types and frequency of illness and health outcomes in different population segments. While cities offer a wide range of public and private providers, the slum population is often excluded and left with inadequate health care provided by unskilled, unlicensed, and unregulated providers. How, then, will health systems have to adjust to adequately meet the health needs of all urban dwellers in an equitable way? C. The Asian Advantage Fortunately, opportunities in Asia abound to propel health and other system responses to these challenges. An increasing number of high-tech health products and services are sufficiently low cost to enter and reshape markets. Mobile technology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare information systems globally. Strategic health governance strategies can tap into significant private health care markets to expand access to care and ensure greater equity within services. Continued general economic growth across Asia provides the opportunity to take advantage of domestic resources for health . Generally, Asian countries have a robust, although poorly regulated or unregulated, private health sector (for-profit and nonprofit), therefore public purchasing of private health care services can address inequities in access to services but quality is uneven. This context lends itself to testing innovative approaches to improve the urban ecosystem in a way that will not only sustain good health outcomes for today's most pressing diseases over the long term, but can ensure responsive health care services as epidemiology and populations change over time. New approaches require bold ambition and the willingness to take risks with health care processes, but not with clinical outcomes . D. Background: USAID's Health Priorities in Asia Four main themes guide the Asia Bureau/Health Team's work: 1) Development programming that builds resilient and responsive health systems while maximizing sustainable impact on system performance and population health outcomes; this supports the larger agency goal of reducing poverty and managing maternal mortality, child health, and infectious disease threats. 2) Harnessing the evidence base to better understand sustainable solutions to health system challenges; 3) Enabling information sharing across Asia by building the institutional capacity of regional networks; and 4) Exploring intersections with other technical areas and partnering with the private sector to maximize potential for impact. Within the above areas of emphasis, the USAID/Asia Bureau Health Team focuses on the following areas of work, in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 11 and the USAID/Global Health Bureau's goals . Universal Health Coverage and Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) USAID's Vision for HSS is to partner with countries to provide sustained, equitable access to essential, high-quality health services that are responsive to people's needs without financial hardship, thereby protecting poor and underserved people from illness, death, and extreme poverty. Its purpose is to guide USAID's work and investment focus to evidence-based HSS approaches that contribute to positive health outcomes and to foster an environment conducive to universal health coverage. Many countries in Asia and the Pacific have committed, or are planning to commit, to delivering universal health coverage to their populations through their health systems, which are mixed (i.e. public and private sector delivery operates side by side) and the strength of these systems vary widely across lower and lower-middle income countries. Often the financing, supply, and policy elements of developing Asian health systems are not optimally regulated. Non-public providers, including informal, unregulated, and unskilled providers (such as unlicensed pharmacists) are operating outside of the formal health system and make up a large proportion of primary care providers that are often utilized by the urban poor, resulting in inequitable access to essential, high-quality health services and safe medical products. With significant out-of-pocket expenditures for health and inadequate financial protection schemes, many governments have passed laws to establish national health insurance systems and have developed health financing strategies. The move toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC), including access for all and financial protection, is proving to be challenging. Poor and disadvantaged populations often are not covered by these schemes, and protecting the poor is not usually prioritized while most of the investments are in fact expanding the formal private sector. Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health, and Family Planning ? Asia and the Pacific account for more than 41 percent of under-five deaths in the world, more than 44 percent of maternal deaths, more than 56 percent of newborn deaths, and approximately 60 percent of stunted rates for children under five. ? There are still large disparities between the lowest and highest wealth quintiles in vaccine coverage in countries such as India, Indonesia, and Vietnam or within a geographic area such as Cambodia and Myanmar in the Mekong. ? Fifty-five percent of all people globally who require family planning services but do not have effective access to them live in Asia and the Pacific. ? Despite regional economic growth, many women living in urban areas have no access to skilled providers. Only 41 percent of expectant mothers in South Asia have a skilled birth attendant present during deliveries- one of the lowest rates in the world.There are huge disparities in access to antenatal care and skilled birth attendance. ? Compared to Africa, rates of facility delivery are lower in Asia and a greater proportion of deliveries are in private facilities. In Asia, living in an urban area, being in a higher wealth quintile, and living in a non-male household head were significantly associated with increased odds of delivering in a facility. Nutrition and Sanitation ? Asia is home to 62 percent of world's undernourished children. Among the top 30 countries globally for moderate to severe stunting, seven countries are in Asia: Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Timor Leste. ? At the same time a dual burden of malnutrition is emerging, combining under-nutrition and overweight and obesity among mothers and children. This often leads to hypertension, which may cause pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and complicated deliveries, resulting in worse health outcomes for both mother and baby. ? The number of overweight children is increasing most rapidly in Asia. ? Over- and under-nutrition alike have distinct effects on risk of TB infection: Diabetes enhances the risk of pulmonary TB, but a greater body mass index (BMI) is protective against TB -- yet diabetes is more frequent among people who are overweight. Low BMI is also a risk factor for TB infection. ? Approximately 1.7 billion people in Asia have no access to sanitation-an increasing problem for urban areas where communities grounded on poor infrastructure are on the rise. An average of 780 million people in the region have limited or no access to safe drinking water, and urban populations, particularly those living in slums share environmental risks, experiencing so-called neighbourhood effect. Many still practice open defecation and 80% of wastewater is discharged with little or no treatment, resulting in diarrheal disease, malnutrition, and pollution. In fact slum dwellers perceive water and sanitation as their most pressing need. Infectious Diseases The high concentration of people living and interacting with others in urban places can increase the risk and rate of disease transmission. The ability of urban centers (through local or devolved national government action) to respond to rapid increases or high incidence of infectious disease is critical to improving health outcomes in a more urbanized Asia. HIV ? The Asia region is home to the largest number of people living with HIV outside of sub-Saharan Africa. There are approximately 5 million people living with HIV- 340,000 new cases per year in the region, and only 1.9 million currently on treatment, which lags behind global trends. ? Though countries in Asia have made tremendous progress in tackling the HIV epidemic, HIV remains a key issue within specific populations. The epidemic in these countries is concentrated among key populations: drug injecting users, sex workers, and men who have sex with men. Tuberculosis ? Nine of the world's 22 high burden tuberculosis countries, which together account for more than 80 percent of the world's TB cases, are in Asia and include: Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In 2014, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions, accounting for 58 percent of new cases globally. Malaria: ? Despite many public health advancements in the region, 65 million people in Southeast Asia are at risk of malaria infection. An estimated 260,000 people are infected with malaria each year in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. The true number, however, is likely much higher because of poor detection and reporting in rural areas where the disease is common. ? Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in five countries of the Greater Mekong sub-region: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The majority of patients with artemisinin-resistant parasites still recover after treatment, provided that they are treated with an effective artemisinin-based combination therapy; however, the market for counterfeit and substandard drugs will continue to impede development efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality if unaddressed. Emerging Infectious Diseases: ? Emerging infectious diseases of pandemic potential, such as influenza viruses of animal origin and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), remain persistent threats to livelihoods, food security and health across Asia. The economic cost of the 2003 SARS epidemics is estimated at US$ 54 Billion by the World Bank. The emergence of avian influenza A/H7N9 in China underscores the dynamic nature of such threats, and the importance of prompt, evidence-based control of emerging diseases at their source in order to mitigate negative regional and global public health impacts. ? There is no denying the staggering financial implications of pandemics: if an outbreak is not rapidly controlled, it could result in major losses of livelihoods affecting both rural and ruban communities; a projected reduction in global trade by 14 percent; and cause economic losses in Asia worth $263 billion, a 5% loss of the global GDP. Pandemics also shock a health system, with immediate stressors on the health workforce to rapidly mobilize and continue to provide essential, routine services as well as those that directly address the infectious disease outbreak. ? The vulnerability of Asia to climate change, with consequences such as the destruction of land and habitat, food production, and increased mortality risks due to disaster such as earthquakes, floods and tropical cyclones increase physical barriers to healthcare access. With long-term effects such as land erosion, an increase in migration to urban areas will result in an increased demand for urban health services. Climate change also changes the epidemiology of communicable diseases, such as the distribution of mosquito vectors which changes the patterns of transmission of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and more recently the Zika virus. This will also burden an already weak health system that is not prepared to respond these types of shocks. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) NCDs are the leading cause of premature death and disability in all regions of the world except Africa, where they are expected to be the leading cause by 2030 and they are one of the major challenges for development in the twenty-first century. The top NCD killers in the Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific regions are cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and cancer. In the Asia Pacific region, 62 percent of annual deaths in the South East Asia region are due to NCDs in the South East Asia region while 75 percent of deaths in the Western Pacific region are due to NCDs. The WHO estimated that the highest worldwide increment in total mortality in a 10-year time frame (2005-2015) will be observed in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions with 21 percent increase in the South-East Asia region and 12.3 million deaths in the Western Pacific region. 48 percent of deaths due to NCDs in South East Asia occur before the age of 70 years, thus largely affecting economically productive individuals. Furthermore, smoking, second-hand smoke, obesity, and diabetes during pregnancy are linked to preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, macrosomia, obstructed labour, and the need for caesarean delivery. Increases in NCDs are due to in large part to ageing populations, urban development planning and growth, climate change and the lack of readiness of health systems and other systems to address NCDs. High out-of-pocket payments to care for and treat NCDs push people into poverty. Countries moving towards UHC aim to provide financial health protection and access to NCD services, including early diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care. There will be an increased demand for patient-centered care and as countries develop their benefit packages, they will need to decide which NCD services they can cover for their populations and how they can pay for them. Countries will need to ensure that their pharmaceutical systems and the health workforce are efficiently and effectively ensuring that NCD related commodities and services are high quality, available, and accessible to all, especially the poor, underserved and vulnerable populations. While the behavioral risk factors that contribute to NCDs are tobacco use, unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity and harmful use of alcohol, which are more prevalent in urban areas, NCDs are largely preventable and cost-effective interventions are available. II. OBJECTIVE & AREAS OF INTEREST A. Objective This Addendum seeks, through co-creation with local partners, systems approaches to overcoming urban health challenges in Asia. The Addendum should support one or more of USAID's health goals as outlined in Section I and pursue solutions that improve Asian urban cities'/municipalities' ability to equitably improve health outcomes. B. Areas of Interest While growth in megacities and primary cities will continue, growth in secondary cities will occur more rapidly, in more places, and place more strain on the infrastructure and governance to adapt. As available space is already limited in large and mega-cities, secondary cities will likely rapidly become home to the majority of a country's urban residents. These cities will require more attention to adequately plan and deploy of resources since their low capacity to address the needs of urban dwellers is insufficient. These secondary cities typically have weaker governance and a lower ability to access resources than primary cities, which will contribute to a range of public health associated needs. As such, the geographic focus of this Addendum focuses on any city of 750,000 to five million population with a recent annual population growth rate of three percent or more in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, and Vietnam. The Addendum will support targeted approaches for shaping functioning models of resilient and equitable health systems in urban settings. Health and other systems in Asia's rapidly urbanizing cities must increasingly respond to shocks-be they natural disasters, economic crises, acts of terrorism, food insecurity or infectious disease outbreaks-while at the same time, evolve to address a multitude of transitions that impact health and be designed to address the dual burden of diseases due to the aging population. As such, this Addendum will focus on new approaches and models that will contribute to resilient, equitable urban health systems that can deliver quality health services and improve health outcomes for all members of the urban population. Rather than embarking on comprehensive urban health systems reform, we are interested in targeted interventions that test different approaches to optimize a health element of a city's existing health system. What nudges does any one piece of the health system need to operate more efficiently and effectively? For example: ? What tools or processes work best to support an urban health system that is resilient to external shocks and overcomes barriers to utilization such as distance and cost ? What are effective models of how philanthropy, social entrepreneurialism, and/or corporate social responsibility improve access to quality health services and contribute to the creation of and effective, equitable and resilient health system in urban areas? ? What are the most cost-effective ways of reaching urban slum-dwellers with essential health services provided by qualified providers, which are affordable? This is needed to mitigate the risk of being pushed into poverty due to the cost of catastrophic illness, which may affect all wealth quintiles. ? What are some effective ways of integrating NCD detection, prevention, and management into primary health care services while maintaining communicable disease detection, treatment, and prevention efforts at the primary care level? ? What innovations in management, recordkeeping, health information systems, disease surveillance, or service delivery that improve health outcomes have the greatest potential to be sustainable so as to ensure integration into the country's urban health system? ? What successful approaches and policies can be used to improve cross-sectoral planning, governance, and synergies among health, sanitation, urban planning, environmental, and other directorates beyond health to maximize the investments-and potential outcomes-of all sectors? ? What can be done to improve disease surveillance systems? ? How to improve health information systems that will allow disaggregation of information by economic status and differentiate between slum-non slum populations? ? What are effective models of engaging with unregulated, untrained health care providers in urban settings so that slum-dwellers can get quality care? ? What are ways to engage urban communities in local health planning, oversight of the provision of care, and to improve the accountability of all providers? This illustrative list is not exhaustive by any means. It is meant to give offerors a sense of the scale of approaches we are interested in testing and the level of investment for those approaches.

BAA-OAA-RM-2017 HARNESSING LOCAL INNOVATIONS, EXPERTISE, AND PARTNERSHIPS TO SOLVE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN ASIA ADDENDUM NO. 2 - ASEAN AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 1. Purpose This is an Addendum to the Harnessing Local Innovations, Expertise, and Partnerships to Solve Development Challenges in Asia under BAA number BAA-OAA-RM-2017 issued on February 1, 2017. The purpose of this Addendum is to request Expressions of Interest (EOI) for research, innovation and collaboration in support of increasing access to finance for entrepreneurs and small- and medium-sized agribusinesses (SMAs) in the ASEAN region. In this activity, USAID seeks to increase the productivity and profitability of such businesses across agricultural value chains in the region by (1) increasing their access to debt finance and (2) developing new agricultural technologies, business process improvements, and improving small trade infrastructure. The goal of this project is to increase access to finance for SMAs operating across the ASEAN countries in which USAID works (including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Burma, Philippines, and Vietnam). This Addendum is a competitive approach to consider ideas that advance the state-of-the-art, allowing USAID to reach out to potential partners with recognized expertise in relevant areas, and to co-create, co-design, co-invest, and collaborate with partners. 2. Background Agriculture and agribusinesses are key drivers behind the ASEAN region's economic growth. Southeast Asia is one of the most productive agricultural baskets in the world, producing 129 million tons of rice, 40 million tons of corn, 171 million tons of sugarcane, 1.44 million tons of soybean, and 70.34 million tons of cassava in 2012. Advances in technology and regional connectivity have made it easier for such commodities to enter global value chains. In addition to being home to over 600 million people, ASEAN is also strategically located between major East Asia and South Asia markets, making it an ideal supply and processing base for agribusinesses with an eye for expansion and growth. Since over half the total population in Southeast Asia depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, many are entrepreneurs who work in agriculture, or employed by SMAs. Despite its importance to agricultural growth, SMAs often suffer from low productivity and declining growth rates. These businesses have limited access to inputs, information, technology, markets and affordable working capital as well as growth capital to expand their business. Furthermore, many of these businesses have a disproportionate impact on women, who, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, account for nearly half of the agricultural labor force in Southeast Asia but generally have less access to productive resources compared to men. Despite this, SMAs remain critically integral to ASEAN economies. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for more than 96% of the private sector and for between 50 and 95% of employment in many ASEAN economies. Additionally, the contribution of these businesses to GDP (ranging from 30 to 50%) and to exports (ranging from 19 to 31%) is significant. Given increased economic integration in the ASEAN region and stronger trade ties globally, there remains significant potential for SMAs to increasingly contribute to Southeast Asia's development through greater participation in global value chains. These factors highlight the need for improved access to information, technology, and private capital for agribusinesses in order to promote market systems development for not only the member economies that make up ASEAN, but for ASEAN as a region. With the regional connectivity objectives and growth of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the AEC has laid the legal, regulatory, and technological infrastructure to streamline trade between member states, allowing for faster movement of agricultural goods across borders and long distances. Increased AEC connectivity opens a new market opportunity for businesses in the region to integrate into regional and international value chains. This growth and opportunity, however, will demand new sources of financing such as working capital and investment loans as well as technical assistance. 3. Objective and Areas of Interest USAID seeks, through partnerships with the private sector, innovative approaches to expand access to technology, information, and capital for innovative agribusiness entrepreneurs in the ASEAN region. USAID encourages market actors to address some or all the issues raised in Section 2 and ultimately help to deepen market systems throughout Southeast Asia. The ultimate objective of this activity is to increase the productivity and profitability of businesses across agricultural value chains in the region by (1) increasing their access to debt finance for expanding throughout Southeast Asia and (2) developing new agricultural technologies, business process improvements, and improving small trade infrastructure. Such approaches should consider incorporating the following factors: ? Leveraging existing USAID tools for engaging with the private sector, including a partial credit guarantee by USAID's Development Credit Authority and technical assistance to investors and SMAs; ? Strengthening market linkages to enterprises, lead firms and financial service providers in the region; ? Alignment with existing USAID programming in Southeast Asian market systems and the overall mission of Feed the Future (FTF), the U.S. government's global hunger and food security initiative; ? A truly regional (not bilateral) ASEAN scope that includes at least 2 ASEAN nations in which USAID currently works (including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Burma, Philippines, and Vietnam); ? An emphasis on supporting and capitalizing on regional connectivity under the AEC; ? Partnerships and synergies with other private sector stakeholders, including investors, companies, and NGOs, as well as with other international development organizations; and ? Creative solutions to fostering rural-urban linkages focused on inclusive economic growth. The illustrative list above is not exhaustive by any means and is meant to give offerors a sense of the issues USAID would like to address within this activity. 4. Instructions for Submitting Expressions of Interest USAID will review Expressions of Interest (EOI) in accordance with the instructions and evaluation criteria set forth in this Addendum. EOIs must indicate the research or development idea(s) that will deliver potential solutions to the Objective stated in Section 3.

The United States for International Development (USAID) invites interested parties to partner with USAID to identify leap frog or other new technologies, innovative solutions, and promising program approaches that can solve development problems in the Asia region. This BAA seeks to incorporate innovative ideas and unorthodox partnerships that can achieve sustainable results. B. Federal Agency Name The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), administered through the Asia Bureau. Opportunity Title HARNESSING LOCAL INNOVATIONS, EXPERTISE, AND PARTNERSHIPS TO SOLVE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN ASIA . Opportunity Number BAA-OAA-RM-2017 Announcement Type This BAA serves to inform the public of the opportunity for possible funding from USAID for innovative, applied research to address development challenges in Asia. This BAA is not a request to receive information from interested parties. USAID will issue periodic addenda to this BAA seeking sustainable solutions, scalability opportunities, feasibility studies and other research and development initiatives addressing specific development challenges in Asia. The terms of this BAA apply to each addendum. Each individual addendum may have specific instructions, requirements for evaluation criteria, and administrative information, such as the requirements for expressions of interest, concept papers, and response deadlines. This BAA is open through March 3, 2017 (5:00 PM EST) and any opportunities for funding and partnering will be issued separately as Addenda to this BAA. Authority This BAA is issued under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 35.016 (c). This is not a FAR Part 15 procurement. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number 98.001 USAID Foreign Assistance Programs for Overseas COLLABORATION The intent of the BAA is to allow co-creation and co-design to the maximum extent possible to identify effective partnerships and innovative approaches to more rapidly solve development problems. Collaboration can include: Co-creation: Co-creation occurs after an Expression of Interest (EOI) is approved, but before the concept is developed. The potential partner(s), the Government (represented by the Activity Manager), and other stakeholders involved work together to write and/or revise the Concept Paper(s), and jointly present to USAID's Asia Bureau Review Board for consideration. Co-design/development: Co-design/development occurs after the Asia Bureau Review Board has reviewed the Concept Paper(s), recommends the project for further development, and the Contracting Officer or Agreement Officer has determined the proposer(s) to be an Apparently Successful Partner. At this point, the Contracting Officer or Agreement Officer may determine the general nature of the award type or specific award type, depending on the nature of the project, to facilitate project design. During co-design, the Apparently Successful Partner and the Activity Manager will design the technical approach, general resource requirements, and management control of the project under the guidance of the Contracting Officer/Agreement Officer. Co-investment: Co-investment refers to the US Government's strategic aim that the partnerships resulting from the individual BAA awards represent opportunities to achieve mutual or complementary development goals of the partner, USAID, and potentially other resource partners, and therefore embrace shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing. Shared resourcing may be accomplished through funding by both parties, either through cash resources or the exchange of resources, both tangible and intangible, such as in kind contributions, expertise, intellectual property, brand value, high-value coordination, and access to key people, places, and information. Co-investing does not require equally sharing resources (such as a 1:1 leverage), but rather resource contributions that are appropriate to the specific project's objectives, considering the comparative advantages brought by the participation of each party and the award type. SPECIFIC RIGHTS RESERVED FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER THIS BAA The U.S. Government reserves specific rights, in addition to rights described elsewhere in this document or by law or regulation, including: The right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no awards. If an award is made, funding is subject to availability. Some award types may not include any funding. The right to make awards without discussions, or to conduct discussions and/or negotiations, whichever is determined to be in the Government's interest. The right to accept proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of proposals for award or co-investment. The right to select for award an instrument type that is appropriate to the specific development context, partner relationship, and proposal selected for award. Instrument types include but are not limited to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, Global Development Alliance agreements, Development Innovation Agreements, Inter-Agency Agreements, Government to Government Agreements, Donor to Donor Agreements, and Memorandums of Understanding. In addition, the Government may craft a new instrument type to meet the needs of a specific relationship. The right to co-create projects with one or more potential partners under this BAA, when it is in the best interest of the Government. The right to request any additional, necessary documentation upon initial review. Such additional information may include, but is not limited to, a further detailed proposal, budget, and representations and certifications. The right to fund or co-invest in proposals in phases, with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases. The right to award instruments that do not commit or exchange monetary resources. The right to remove proposers from award consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement on award terms, conditions, and/or cost/price within a reasonable time; the proposer fails to provide requested additional information in a timely manner; or the Government believes it is in its best interest to do so. IV. PROBLEM AND CHALLENGE STATEMENTS Problem Statement In recent decades, Asia's tremendous economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty, malnutrition, and disease at rates unprecedented in human history. Yet, Asia's growth model relies heavily on an unsustainable use of resources and has created growing inequalities that undermine the region's future economic growth and can threaten countries' stability. In addition, weak institutional frameworks and inequitable services for vulnerable populations across the region mean that many people do not participate fully in Asia's growth. Specific challenges include: Vulnerability of Natural Resources: Asia's growth in gross domestic product and consumption has come at great cost to the region's natural resources, the global climate, and ultimately the region's ability to sustain broad-based development over the long-term. Unplanned urban development and the expansion of cities and towns puts further pressure on resources and the communities that use them. The degradation of land, water, and other natural resources undermines long-term sustainable economic growth, food security, and water availability, as well as increases the risk of public health threats and disasters. In addition, global climate change will continue to strain the resiliency of vulnerable communities throughout the region. Projected greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the Asia region are alarmingly high. Rapidly increasing energy demand to fuel growing economies and cities across the Asia region is the principal driver behind increasing GHG emissions. Asia's energy demand is growing faster than any other region in the world. Climate change is shifting the fundamental rules of city planning and administration. The density of people, economic activity in the coastal areas, and increasing frequency and severity of weather events make cities especially vulnerable to climate change. The extreme weather events in the Asia region have caused extensive damage to human life and infrastructure, but have also generated significant economic disruptions. Cities and rural areas alike must learn to adapt to these changes and become more resilient. Once core vulnerabilities are identified, countries need to work with the development and business communities to better manage change and reduce overall risk levels. Inclusive Economic Growth: As Asia grows in population and economically, increasing disparities pose critical challenges to the region's inclusive and sustainable development. Income disparities within individual countries continue to widen throughout the region, which can dampen the poverty-reducing impacts of economic growth. Asia's Gini coefficient--a measure of income inequality--increased dramatically from 39 to 46 in less than 20 years, resulting in the conclusion that ""Asia is getting less poor, but more unequal."" As many Asian nations transition from largely rural economies, the importance of strong rural-urban linkages becomes pivotal in order to ensure connectivity between farmers and businesses in the rural community and the growing urban population in not just primary, but also secondary and tertiary cities. Efficient market systems and integration into global agricultural value chains are vital for the economic health of many Asian countries. As drivers of economic growth and innovation, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) often lack access to critical finance and other technical support needed to operate their businesses as well as to grow and expand their market. The lack of regional connectivity and trade barriers between countries also severely limit MSMEs' growth potential and continue to plague the economic potential of South, Central, and Southeast Asia. Finally, empowering oft-neglected groups to fully participate in economic and financial systems remain a significant challenge in Asia. In particular, women, youth, and ethnic and religious minorities frequently cannot access financing and employment in certain industries due to onerous legal, regulatory, and cultural barriers. Without inclusive economic growth for all, poverty and inequality will continue to restrict the economic potential of Asia, which still houses over 770 million people living on below $1.25 per day. Rule of Law and Human Rights: Despite Asia's improving economic outlook, the progress of ""rights-based"" development, inclusion and service provision for vulnerable and marginalized populations is still lagging. Institutional and legal frameworks to protect and ensure their access to information and services are underdeveloped or not fully implemented. Considerable numbers of migrant workers and ""modern day slaves"", despite contributing to economic growth, suffer from prejudice and discrimination. They also face difficulty in accessing essential health and legal services in host countries, especially those who are undocumented and fear engaging with government institutions. Although sexual minorities, including gay, lesbian and transgender persons, are tolerated in some Asian countries, weak human rights context and stigma are important factors conditioning the HIV response and service uptake in mainstream services. Across the region, civil society organizations representing the voices of vulnerable groups are mostly in early developmental stages, although these initial efforts are essential for promoting resilient and inclusive democratic societies. Health related challenges: Countries in Asia have reached unprecedented levels of economic growth, yet a vast percentage of the population still struggles with poor health and difficulty accessing affordable, quality healthcare services. In some instances, the urban growth that has been fueled by economic development may have negative consequences for health status and health outcomes. Government spending on public health remains low and is often not focused on those who need it most. Maternal and child morbidity and mortality remain a great challenge with Asia, accounting for more than 41% of under-five deaths in the world, more than 44% of maternal deaths, more than 56% of newborn deaths, and approximately 60% of stunted rates for children under 5. In addition to serious health risks, an outbreak of pandemic proportions in Asia would have massive economic consequences. According to research ""a future pandemic could lower Asia's growth rate to zero and reduce the global trade of goods and services by 14%"". In addition, Asia is facing unprecedented challenges in terms of grappling with the rise of non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, along with the communicable diseases that continue to impact the region including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. This epidemiological transition, coupled with aging populations, will burden the health systems of the region unless a transition is considered now to support the adaptation of health systems. Education: The Asia Region benefits from high rates of primary school enrollment, averaging 90%. However, questions around the quality of education and dropout rates remain of serious concern. In addition enrollment rates at the secondary school level are much lower. Other challenges relate to a lack in adequate facilities, comprehensive policy, and weaknesses curricula and education service delivery. Opportunities Despite these challenges, a number of these aspects can be leveraged to increase the region's focus on sustainable growth and development. Asia's strong economic growths, with an active and engaged private sector both local and multinational corporations, including small and medium enterprises, can be a positive force for reducing poverty and creating sustainable change. Globally, Asia remains extremely strong in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. There is local expertise and innovation in areas crucial to sustainable development, such as supply chain, natural resource management, and human capital. Asia has an increasing number of high net worth individuals who are responding to the global call for social investment and who can serve as potential resource for growth. Asia is rich in technology, innovation, and capital (both human and financial). It has the highest number of researchers and internet users worldwide, and offers platforms for innovation to help the many poor within its borders. Expanding access to information technologies can spur innovation and growth and enhance public service delivery. These technologies can also be harnessed to tackle unsustainable practices that undermine long-term prosperity for Asia and tap into burgeoning human and financial capital. Maximizing the growth of cities and strengthening urban-rural linkages in the region will be critically important in the near future. By 2025, nearly 2.5 billion Asians will live in cities, accounting for almost 54 percent of the world's urban population. This urban growth represents both an opportunity and a challenge as statistics for the past 20 years have shown that urbanization corresponds to reduced poverty and inequality. Urban centers, or secondary cities, can become hubs for nearby rural communities by becoming ""Smart Cities."" While fulfilling the energy, transportation, healthcare, building, infrastructure, and governance needs of the population, such Smart Cities also represent a market for goods and services valued at over US $1.5 trillion annually providing employment opportunities for surrounding areas. The economic benefits of supporting these Smart Cities are widespread and are a critical driver of poverty reduction. Asia has become more connected economically, politically, and socially, and there is growing support for transnational cooperation. Regional institutions, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), offer platforms for broader regional economic integration which have the potential to disseminate sustainable, equitable social, economic and non-economic gains including employment and business opportunities as well as greater choices of quality goods and services. B. Challenge Statement To develop and test innovative solutions that will accelerate progress towards sustainable development in Asia. All areas described in the Problem Statement above are amenable to such new solutions. Specific challenge statements to address one or more sectors described in the Problem Statement will be issued separately through Addenda to this BAA. General criteria for consideration Each individual BAA addendum will specify the criteria for selection. Submissions are not evaluated against other submissions but solely against the evaluation criteria from the BAA and applicable BAA addendum. Please review the criteria below carefully as all points will need to be addressed in order to be considered. How does the proposed idea/approach advance one or more of USAID's areas of interest as articulated in Section IV? How does the proposed idea/approach introduce a fresh perspective, and/or non-traditional solution for achieving one of USAID's areas of interests? How does the proposed idea/approach demonstrate the potential for significant impact? How does the proposed idea/approach include ideas for collaborative financing/cost-sharing, including local financing? How is the proposed idea/approach technically sound and grounded in evidence and analysis? Is the proposed idea/approach feasible? Is the context in for which the proposed idea/approach will be piloted and scaled clear and realistic? The reputations of organizations, their past performance, and the managerial and technical ability of the person or team engaged in the endeavor are significant considerations in assessing the potential and the risks associated with each award. VI. Award Stages The amount of resources potentially available under this BAA will depend on the concepts received and the availability of funds. Some award types may not include any funding. The award process under this BAA has the following steps: Stage 1 Expressions of Interest (EOI). EOI must indicate the research or development idea which will work towards discovering potential solutions the Problem and Challenge Statement(s) by increasing knowledge and understanding of potential solutions, exploiting scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, materials, processes, methods, devices, or techniques, advancing the state of the art, or using scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of a potential new product or service (or of an improvement in an existing product or service). All potential partners may not move forward to Stage 2. Due to the large number of expected EOI submissions, USAID is unable to provide detailed information of non-selection to those not selected to advance to Stage 2. Stage 2 Development of the Concept Paper. For Expressions of Interest which are deemed to have merit by USAID and pass criteria/eligibility stated within the BAA and/or specific addenda, USAID will issue an invitation to collaborate to the potential partner(s).* Note that due to the large number of Expressions of Interest, USAID is unable to provide detailed information to those EOIs that are not selected to move forward. Working together, USAID and the potential partner(s) will collaborate on a Concept Paper(s). It is during this phase of co-creation or co-design that the parties will begin to determine additional partners and resources to complement the project. The Concept Paper, generally 5-10 pages in length, will further detail and explain the project as initially provided in the Expression of Interest. Additional Partners/Resources. During the project co-creation and co-design, both the Apparently Successful Partner and USAID will identify additional partners and resources, and whether additional resources are necessary to implement the project. *An invitation is sent to a potential partner to participate in a co-creation workshop, conference, meeting, or the method designated by USAID to work together with all invitees to further develop the idea presented in the expression of interest. All potential partners may not move forward to Stage 3. Stage 3 Review by the Asia Bureau Review Board. Concept Papers developed during Stage 2 will be reviewed by the Asia Bureau Review Board, comprised of experts from USAID and possibly outside parties. The Asia Bureau Review Board will review Concept Papers and recommend which applicants should be considered Apparently Successful Partners. Using its technical expertise, the Asia Bureau Review Board will recommend whether to move forward with the project including revisions/additions to the project, and potential partners and resources. All Apparently Successful Partners may not move forward to Stage 4. Stage 4 Contracting/Agreement Officer Determination. The Contracting/Agreement Officer will review the Asia Bureau Review Board's recommendations and consider other information, such as resource availability, preliminary partner responsibility assessment, and Agency priorities, and will make a determination that the respondent is an Apparently Successful Partner(s). The Contracting/Agreement Officer may also determine or narrow down the anticipated instrument type to facilitate project design. Request for Additional Information. USAID will work with partners identified by the Asia Bureau Review Board, and co-design the project and assist the partner to provide additional information with respect to the proposer's technical approach, capacity, management and organization, past performance, and budget, as well as representations and certifications, as needed. Final Review and Negotiation. The USAID Contract/ Agreement Officer will engage in final review, negotiation, and determination of instrument type, responsibility, cost reasonableness, etc., and will craft an award instrument with the Apparently Successful Partner(s). If the Apparently Successful Partner(s) and USAID cannot arrive at a mutually agreeable arrangement, the Contract/ Agreement Officer will cancel the project at no cost to the Government. Award. Where USAID determines that the award of an instrument is appropriate, the USAID Contract/ Agreement Officer will award the instrument. VII. Award Information If awards are made, the number of awards could vary and may not mirror the number of expressions of interests or invitees to co-creation. However, the following will be applied in the event an award is made: Awards under this BAA will be made to Apparently Successful Partners on the basis of their ability to further USAID's goal of improving the impact of its policies and programs of Asia's poor. USAID is seeking new applications of science, innovations, and partnerships that provide the best value to the Government and have the potential to substantially contribute to these goals. B Proposals identified for negotiation may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, Global Development Alliance agreement, Development Innovation Agreement, Inter-Agency Agreement, Government to Government Agreement, Donor to Donor Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding or alternative agreement type, depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of Government involvement, and other factors. The Government Contracting/Agreement Officer will determine award instrument type and negotiate instrument terms and conditions with selectees. USAID may select the award instruments it deems appropriate. C Eligibility Information. Public, private, for-profit, and nonprofit organizations, as well as institutions of higher education, public international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental organizations, multilateral and international donor organizations are eligible under this BAA. All organizations must be determined to be responsible to perform or participate in the final award type. D Standard Clauses and Provisions of Award. The standard clauses or provisions for awards are generally prescribed by law and regulation and will vary considerably by award type. Information regarding clauses and provisions will be offered to the proposer when the award type is identified. E. Cost Sharing or Leveraging. Organizations are encouraged to consider providing reasonable cost sharing, leverage, or other exchange of resource arrangements, and are encouraged to suggest creative approaches to resourcing projects. Whether cost share and/or leverage are required will be determined by the individual BAA Addendum, final award type, and/or the mutual agreement of the parties. Nothing in this BAA precludes reasonable cost sharing, leveraging, or other exchange of resource arrangements. VIII. Information Protection USAID's goal is to facilitate research and development that will lead to innovative, and potentially commercially viable, solutions. Understanding the sensitive nature of submitters' information, USAID will work with organizations to protect intellectual property. EOIs should be free of any intellectual property that the submitter wishes to protect, as the EOIs may be shared with USAID partners as part of the selection process. However, once submitters have been invited to engage in further discussions, submitters will work with USAID to identify proprietary information that requires protection. Therefore, organizations making submissions under this BAA grant to USAID a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to use, disclose, reproduce, and prepare derivative works, and to have or permit others to do so to any information contained in the expressions of interest submitted under the BAA. If USAID engages with the organization regarding its submission, the parties can negotiate further intellectual property protection for the organization's intellectual property. Organizations must ensure that any submissions under this BAA are free of any third party proprietary data rights that would impact the license granted to USAID herein.

"BAA-GLOBAL-HEALTH-2016","BAA-GLOBAL-HEALTH-2016, Addendum 4","SECTION A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Program Summary United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand Challenges Canada (funded by the Government of Canada), UK's Department of International Development (DFID), and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) have joined together to launch the seventh round of Saving Lives at Birth: A Grand Challenge for Development. Together, we call for groundbreaking prevention and treatment approaches for pregnant women and newborns in poor, hard-to-reach communities around the time of childbirth. An estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 2.7 million neonatal deaths and 303,000 maternal deaths occur globally each year, signaling a major gap in interventions specifically around childbirth and the early postnatal period - a time when mothers and babies are most vulnerable and global progress in reducing mortality has been particularly poor. This gap in interventions is particularly acute in poor, underserved communities and among women who are disadvantaged. Innovative ideas that can leapfrog conventional approaches to address inequities and inequalities of care are critical in surmounting these gaps. If we are to accelerate substantial and sustainable progress in reducing maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths at the community level- and contribute to the goals and targets of Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality and the Every Newborn Action Plan - we need to foster and scale innovative prevention and treatment approaches across three domains: (1) Science & technology; (2) Service delivery; and (3) Demand-side innovation that empowers pregnant women, their families, and their communities to practice healthy behaviors and be aware of and access health care during pregnancy, childbirth and the early postnatal period, especially the first two days after birth. We are particularly interested in investing in and supporting approaches that integrate the latest behavior change approaches with scientific and/or technological advances and service delivery platforms into radical solutions for widespread impact on maternal and newborn health. We encourage these ideas that integrate scientific / technological, social and business innovation to foster sustainability. Achieving Impact Significant breakthroughs in innovation often come about when new ideas and disciplines are applied to long-entrenched problems. To harness scientific / technological, social, and business ingenuity, and to catalyze successful implementation at sustained scale, we encourage: a) Development of partnerships that bring together diverse competencies, particularly from the private sector with co-funding. b) Formation of dedicated multidisciplinary/cross-sectoral teams We believe that such collaborations and commitments will enable and deploy stronger and more sustainable solutions. We also believe that bold ideas must be championed by effective, results-driven leaders with the capacity to convene and engage with key influencers. Where partnerships include innovators from low-and middle-income countries, we encourage the designation of the low- and/or middle-income country partner as the Project Manager/ Principle Investigator (PI). Achieving Impact at Scale Critical to the sustained success of innovative solutions is a clear understanding of how best to implement them at scale. Successful applicants will take into account country programs, policies, and priorities. Development of new interventions, technologies or approaches and their successful scale up should complement efforts to strengthen health systems and address broader determinants of health including poverty, inequity, gender inequality, and access to water and sanitation resources, all of which are needed to address this grand challenge for development. Applicants should consider the overall health system readiness to support the introduction and scale up of a solution for sustained impact. Funding Through a rigorous review process, we will identify and support transformational, scalable approaches that advance equity and quality of care to dramatically - and sustainably - reduce deaths and poor birth outcomes for vulnerable women and newborns in the hardest to reach communities of the world. These audacious but achievable ideas with the potential for high-return will be swiftly funded through one of three streams: (1) Seed Funds to develop and assess the feasibility of innovative ideas, (2) Validation Funds to introduce and validate the effectiveness of innovations to reach proof-of-concept, and (3) Transition Funds to transition innovations with demonstrated proof-of-concept toward scale up. For more information on the Saving Lives at Birth program and projects, please visit our website (www.savinglivesatbirth.net). Problem Statement While we have made remarkable progress in recent decades reducing maternal and child mortality globally, notable disparities still remain for mothers with even slower progress for newborns and stillbirths. Critical Conditions The onset of labor continues to mark the start of a high-risk period for both mother and baby that does not ease until at least 48 hours after birth. During this short period of time, an estimated 145,000 maternal deaths, 1.45 million neonatal deaths, and 1.2 million stillbirths occur annually. • For the mother, the critical conditions occurring during pregnancy, labor, and delivery include hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia and eclampsia, serious infections, and obstructed labor. • For the newborn, the critical conditions occurring after birth are serious infections (sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea), intrapartum-related deaths (primarily ""birth asphyxia""), complications of preterm birth, and metabolic conditions (hypothermia, hypoglycemia, etc). • Important causes of stillbirth include intrapartum asphyxia, maternal and antepartum hemorrhage, fetal infection, obstructed labor, Rh disease, and birth defects, especially neural tube defects. Fragmented Continuum of Care Evidence-based interventions-such as skilled attendance at delivery; emergency obstetric and newborn care; early initiation of breastfeeding; hygiene; and rapid diagnosis and early treatment of infections-do exist to manage complications around the time of birth. However, these interventions are not always available to the women and children who need them. Many missed opportunities exist before, during, and after the time of birth that could be tackled to optimize maternal and newborn health outcomes: • Care before Birth: Impeded by delays in seeking prenatal care, limited ability to determine gestational age without reliance on ultrasound technology, and lack of access and/or adherence to prenatal care services and proper nutrition. • Care at Birth: Impeded by a lack of infrastructural and health system resources (e.g. material resources, electricity, oxygen, IV fluids, clean water and adequate transportation to travel to hospitals) and shortages of trained healthcare providers to provide basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care. Where trained professionals and equipped facilities exist, quality of care can be further impeded by poor management and supervision, non- functioning supply chains, and lack of adherence to guidelines and protocols compromising dignity and respect. • Care after Birth: Impeded by a lack of access to postnatal care services, including support for breastfeeding, and delays in seeking care, including family planning resources such as contraception. In fact, important causes of maternal and newborn complications result from births that are spaced too closely due to a lack of access and/or adherence to family planning. Geographical Inequalities Almost all of maternal and newborns deaths during the high-risk period of childbirth occur in low- and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where access to quality care is also the poorest. Inequalities also persist within countries that leave vulnerable women and newborns even more disproportionately affected, as in urban slums or fragile settings of humanitarian emergencies. Social Inequalities Gender norms, cultural beliefs, and traditions that limit a woman's autonomy, inclusion, and decision making power contribute to poor enabling environments that may prevent women and their families from practicing healthy behaviors, and seeking and receiving life-saving care at and around the time of birth. For example, women, their partners and/or their families, and decision-makers may not recognize the signs of potentially life-threatening illness around the time of birth, the cause of those illnesses, or where timely appropriate care is available. Social norms may limit movement outside the household after birth for both the mother and baby; costs of care and transportation options may also limit ability to seek and receive appropriate care. Gender, social and cultural norms may also contribute to the fragmented continuum of care. Taken together, these barriers leave poor, underserved women-who have the greatest geographical, financial and structural challenges in securing quality care at the time of delivery-and their infants at the highest risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. Objective For the purposes of this Addendum, the Saving Lives at Birth partners are seeking creative solutions to address roadblocks to healthy pregnancies and births in three domains, alone or in combination: • Science & Technology: lack of dissemination and uptake of the most recent scientific evidence applicable to delivery of care in low-resource settings; lack of affordable and effective medical solutions appropriate for the community or clinic setting; • Service Delivery: lack of quality health services, including inadequate numbers of trained, supported, motivated, equipped and properly located and supervised health staff and caregivers; and limited by operational bottlenecks; • Demand: lack of opportunity, agency, ability, motivation, and empowerment to access timely health care or adopt healthy behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy. Since many opportunities to optimize maternal and birth outcomes occur before and after the time of birth, solutions do not need to focus solely on the window between labor and 48 hours post-delivery. Where life-saving interventions exist but have not been successfully deployed or implemented, we invite bold ideas for overcoming specific barriers to scaling up. What We Are Looking For Interventions that: • Substantially increase demand for and access to primary health interventions for women and newborns; • Substantially improve the quality of care as measured by health outcomes; and • Improve and sustain healthy behaviors, attitudes, and practices. Solutions should be: • Creative: Bold, ""off the beaten track,"" daring in premise • Appropriate: Designed with and for end-users in the target population or context to meet their specific needs and circumstances • Impactful: Address one or more important adverse maternal, fetal, or neonatal health conditions described in the problem statement above; • Competitive: Clearly differentiated from and superior to standard practice, particularly on factors of cost and ease of use; • Sustainable: Demonstrate a clear path to obtain continued political and financial support for sustained implementation and/or use of the innovation. Partnerships important for scale and matched funding are highly encouraged for solutions transitioning to scale; • Scalable: Demonstrate the potential to increase and sustain coverage and impact of the intervention both within and beyond the award period, and be implemented in contexts or settings outside of those reached during the award period • Measureable: Able to be monitored, measured and evaluated for impact. Strong Areas of Interest We are particularly interested in novel innovations in any of the following areas, but not limited to: • Promoting healthy behaviors and generation of demand for services, including voluntary timing and spacing of pregnancy • Preventing and addressing the consequences of preterm birth • Increasing access to and sustained use of evidence-based, appropriate, quality care with particular emphasis on: o Early uptake and retention in antenatal care and simple, low-tech methods of dating pregnancy o Equity, including identifying and reaching the most vulnerable populations o Accountability to stakeholders and families o Eliminating mistreatment of women during birth o Improving working conditions of and respect for birth attendants o Better monitoring and management of labor to promote maternal and fetal survival and better monitoring and management of special newborn care o Making the ""old and boring"" (but essential and good for maternal and newborn care) seem exciting (e.g. how to take, record, and act upon a blood pressure reading) • Addressing key health system bottlenecks that have an outsized impact on maternal and newborn health services with particular emphasis on improving referral and transportation of mothers with complications and sick newborns, including links to facilities • Addressing underlying gender, social and cultural barriers and/or opportunities • Assessing and addressing the challenges of approaches or technologies proven to work in high-income settings but unproven in low-income settings such as antenatal steroids, progesterone, etc. We encourage integrated solutions that bring together cutting-edge science and/or low-cost technologies, service delivery, and demand innovation in transformative new ways. PLEASE NOTE: Solutions addressing HIV in vertical manner, e.g., HIV diagnostics, will not be considered for funding. Innovation Pipeline The Partners seek solutions across the three stages of development (seed, validation, or transition) described below. Under this Addendum, the Partners will place a greater focus on identifying and supporting innovations to reach scale. Seed Funds • Focus: Seed funds will be provided to support the development and feasibility assessment of ideas capable of impacting health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies in low-resource settings. It is anticipated that projects aiming to develop early-stage prototyes and/or conduct feasibility assessments, including those for scientific advancements, will enter the Saving Lives at Birth program at this stage. • Eligibility: Proposed solutions for seed funds should demonstrate strong understanding of target user(s), such as preliminary evidence from these users that the solution solves a problem they face or meets a need they have. • Funding: Funding levels will correspond to the scope and scale of the innovation but will generally be $250,000 USD per project. • Length of Award: Seed projects will be funded for up to two (2) years. Validation Funds • Focus: Validation funds will be provided to support the introduction and validation of prototypes and innovative approaches in achieving improved health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies in low-resource settings (i.e. reaching proof of concept). • Eligibility: Proposed solutions for validation funds may have been preliminarily tested, but should not be current standard practice. However, innovative variations that aim to demonstrate superiority to existing approaches will be considered (e.g., a new means to deliver an existing service or a new way to make an old model demonstrably more effective or cost effective). Previous Saving Lives at Birth seed awardees are eligible to apply. However, applicants do not need a previous seed award to be eligible for validation funds. • Funding: Funding levels will correspond to the scope and scale of the innovation but will generally be $250,000 USD per project. • Length of Award: Validation projects will be funded for up to two (2) years. Transition Funds • Focus: Transition awards are intended to further refine and rigorously test the impact of integrated solutions that have evidence in a controlled or limited setting of improved health outcome(s) and/or the reduction of significant barrier(s) to health and demand for the solution (i.e., proof of concept). These integrated solutions have the potential to credibly scale to improve the lives of millions of pregnant women and newborns in multiple countries. • Eligibility: Projects for transition funds must have strong evidence of proof of concept (see above) and demand for the solution to warrant expanded support. Submissions must provide sufficient and credible evidence to demonstrate their proof of concept and the link to positive impact on maternal and newborn health that could be sustained and scaled. Without sufficent evidence, prospective partners should consider submitting an expression of interest for another type of award (seed or validation). Demand for the solution by target users and/or local partners must also be demonstrated. Successful applicants will note integration into country programs, policies, and priorities. Transition Funds will be limited to integrated solutions only (approaches that integrate science and technology, service delivery, and demand creation domains in innovative ways). Note that components should be integrated in a meaningful and complementary manner, merely combining three stand-alone components into one project is not considered an integrated solution. A key component of achieving sustainability and scale is partnerships. Reviewers will look for partnerships that contribute expertise relevant to the scale and sustainability of the idea. Co-funding and/or matched funding from partners is highly encouraged, as this demonstrates a key stake in project success by project partners, as well as demand for the solution. • Funding: Funding levels will correspond to the scope and scale of the innovation but will not exceed $2 million USD per project. o Some innovations may require testing at various levels (local, regional, and across several regions) in the transition stage. Strong justification should be made as to how the scale of implementation corresponds to the scope of the project. • Length of Award: Transition awards will be funded for up to four (4) years. SECTION B: SUBMISSION GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS Submission Overview Submission and Review Process and Timeline Expressions of Interest (EOI) must indicate the research or development idea that will work towards discovering potential solutions with impact upon the Objective, above, by increasing knowledge and understanding of potential solutions and their implementation at scale; utilizing scientific discoveries or advancements in technology, processes, methods, devices, or techniques; advancing the state of the art; or using scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of a potential new product or service (or of an improvement in an existing product or service). Submitters should use the instructions and format found at www.savinglivesatbirth.net/apply and note the following basic requirements: • All EOI must be written in English. EOI should be written clearly and with minimal jargon as reviewers will possess a variety of backgrounds and technical expertise. • The EOI must be no longer than 3 pages. Any charts or tables included with the EOI will be considered within the page limits. References and citations to academic publications or other resources are not required but are encouraged. If included as a separate page as end notes, references and citations are not included in the page limits. Biographical descriptions and letters of support are not included in the stated page limits. • All EOI must use a standard font no smaller than11-point font with one-inch margins. • All EOI must be submitted through the online application platform, which can be accessed via the link found at www.savinglivesatbirth.net/apply.

If initial review indicates the EOI merits further consideration, selected organizations or consortia may be invited, individually or in combination, to discuss their proposals with the Saving Lives at Birth partners for co-creation and further due diligence. This process may result in applicants being invited to submit concept notes and attend the DevelopmentXChange in Washington, DC July 25-27, 2017 (estimated dates). DevelomentXChange: To take advantage of the presence of a variety of development actors together in one place, the Partners will host the DevelopmentXChange in Washington, DC (estimated to be July 25-27, 2017). Finalists will display their innovations/innovative ideas in an open marketplace. As part of this event, finalists will have the opportunity to network with each other, with other development experts and innovators, and other potential funders. Finalists will also participate in a series of workshops tailored to the participants' needs such as business planning, fundraising and monitoring and evaluation. The Partners will cover the cost for one representative from each finalist team to attend the DevelopmentXChange. 4. Validation and final selection An Executive Committee or Governing Board for each of the respective funding organization will independently review and validate the panel recommendations to ensure consistency with applicable policies, procedures and practices of the respective funding organization, inclusive of past performance evaluation. As per the BAA, the Partners may engage in co-designing the project and assisting the partner to provide additional information with respect to the proposer's technical approach, capacity, management and organization, partnerships and resources, past performance, and budget, as well as representations and certifications, as needed. The final decision regarding awards, including the amount of funding to award, is the responsibility of the respective funding organization. Award amounts and funding conditions may vary by funding organization. Unsuccessful Projects: Applicants with unsuccessful projects will receive notice that their project was not selected. Information Protection Saving Lives at Birth's goal is to identify and scale up transformative prevention and treatment approaches for pregnant women and newborns around the time of birth. Understanding the sensitive nature of submitters' information, USAID will work with organizations to protect intellectual property. Expressions of Interest should be free of any intellectual property that the submitter wishes to protect, as the EOI will be shared with Saving Lives at Birth partners as part of the selection process. However, once submitters have been invited to engage in further discussions, submitters will work with USAID to identify proprietary information that requires protection. Therefore, organizations making submissions under the BAA Addendum hereby grant USAID a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to use, disclose, reproduce, and prepare derivative works, and to have or permit others to do so to any information contained in the expressions of interest submitted under the BAA Addendum. As noted above, if Saving Lives at Birth engages further with the organization regarding its submission, the parties can negotiate intellectual property protection for the organization's intellectual property. Organizations must ensure that any submissions under the Addendum are free of any third party proprietary data rights that would impact the license granted to USAID herein.

"SOL-674-17-000004","Senior Regional Biomedical HIV Prevention Advisor","The Senior Regional Biomedical HIV Prevention Advisor will be based at the Regional HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) in USAID/Southern Africa, Pretoria, South Africa. One of RHAP's objectives is to provide quality technical assistance to Missions that have PEPFAR programs in the southern Africa region, and as available, beyond the region. To this end, RHAP has a cadre of high caliber Technical Advisors in the areas of Care and Treatment, OVC, Pediatric and Adolescent Care and Treatment, Nutrition, HSS/HRH, Strategic Information (SI), and Bio-Medical Prevention. RHAP seeks to recruit a Senior Regional Bio Medical Advisor to be part of the skilled team of regional advisors that have recognized expertize in the implementation of PEPFAR programs in the region. The region that RHAP supports, Southern Africa, remains the epicenter of the global AIDS epidemic. According to UNAIDS, in 2014 Swaziland had the highest HIV prevalence in the world at 27.7%, followed by Botswana (25.2%) and Lesotho (23.4%). The 9 highest-prevalence countries in the world are in Southern Africa. In the region, only Angola, at 2.4% prevalence has an HIV prevalence of less than 10%. While the rate of new infections is declining in every country, and the number of people living with HIV who are on antiretroviral treatment has increased more than 30-fold since 2004, there are still enormous challenges to reaching the goal of an AIDS Free Generation. In 2014, an estimated 13.6 million people in the region are infected, only 46% (6.4m) of whom are on ART. To achieve the 90-90-90 goal of 81% of PLHIV on ART by 2020, an additional 4.6m PLHIV must be put on ART in the next 5 years. The impact of HIV in the region is also compounded by a rampant tuberculosis epidemic.","Dec 02, 2016 06:00 PM EST","Nov 18, 2016","Nov 18, 2016","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Vernette Duvenhage","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services","SUPPORT SVCS (PROF, ADMIN, MGMT)","N/A","N/A"

"SOL-617-17-000003","USAID/Uganda Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Program","The United States Agency for International Development in Uganda (USAID/Uganda) intends to make a follow-on sole source award to the incumbent contractor, The QED Group, LLC for approximately $4,500,000. Contract # AID-617-C-13-00007 with The QED Group, LLC is a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion type with the period of performance of 06/24/2013 to 06/23/2018. The TEC Increase to this existing Contract services USAID/Uganda through three core components: MONITORING & EVALUATION: Provides technical assistance to USAID/Uganda and its implementing partners to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity, promote evidence-based programming and management, enhance analytical rigor, and evaluate activities and projects. LEARNING & ADAPTATION: Supports USAID/Uganda and its implementing partners to improve organizational practices and capacity for learning and adaptation within staff and processes. This includes conducting organizational network analyses, supporting learning networks, conducting learning reviews, and documenting and facilitating events that promote adaptive management. COORDINATION, COLLABORATION, AND SYNERGY: Works to facilitate collaboration, strengthen stakeholder networks, and broaden relationships with the private sector, the Government of Uganda, and donor partners. USAID/Uganda has recently completed its second iteration of country development cooperative strategy (CDCS 2.0). The Learning Contract has been instrumental in supporting the Mission in developing its through learning reviews, evaluations of activities, launching studies and analysis, hosting stakeholder events and information dissemination. Launching a competition at this stage of the activity would result in an unacceptable delay in transitioning from USAID/Uganda's current CDCS 1.0 to the new strategy. This TEC increase is intended to support the Mission to pivot its current activities and design new activities that are aligned to the new CDCS 2.0. The support will be through continued learning reviews and assessments, management restructuring, embedding systems and integration into new designs; assist in developing a strategy level performance management and learning plan; and socialize the CDCS 2.0 approach to the Mission and implementing partners. Such continuity is critical to USAID to maintain the above mentioned services. The statutory authority permitting the award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(a) (2), which says that ""full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purpose of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation."" It further states in 706.302-70(b) (5) that this authority may be used for ""an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays."" QED has worked closely with USAID/Uganda for over 18 months in the formulation of the new CDCS strategy. The resulting strategy is a marked departure from the traditional approach taken by the earlier CDCS. It is a proactive and innovative strategy that focuses on integration and systems approach across the Mission that is beneficial to USAID. The development of this approach is the result of intensive research, analysis and consultation by QED and the Mission. The understanding, thinking and reasoning behind the approach uniquely places QED to further assist the Mission as it transitions from its current CDCS to the new one. It would be difficult for other sources to gain the same level of intimate understanding and knowledge in a timely manner to support the Mission with its transition. No solicitation package or a request for competitive proposals will be issued. It has been determined that The QED Group, LLC is the only source for the aforementioned services that meets USAID'S requirements and provides the best value.

"SOL-268-16-000003","Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE)","The United States Agency for International Development, Lebanon (USAID/Lebanon) intends to release Solicitation Number SOL-268-16-000003, for a project titled ""Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE)"". The purpose of the activity is to improve livelihoods, support micro finance and expand inclusive finance in Lebanon. The USAID contemplates award of a five-year cost-plus-fixed fee (CPFF) completion type contract. The anticipated award date is o/a September 2016. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services). This procurement will be conducted under full and open competition procedures, pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1). The anticipated date for posting the solicitation is April 13, 2016 and the anticipated closing date to submit proposals is May 12, 2016.  There is currently no incumbent contractor performing the work. DESCRIPTION The purpose of the Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE) project is to improve economic opportunities and livelihoods of low income individuals and microenterprises by expanding and strengthening microfinance associations' and member institutions' services and enhancing entrepreneurs' business skills. To this end, LIFE will improve livelihoods, strengthen microfinance activities and advance inclusive finance. Inclusive Finance, also referred to as financial inclusion, is defined as ""universal access to a broad range of financial services, at a reasonable cost, provided by a diversity of sound and sustainable institutions."" LIFE will consolidate the gains made under the Lebanon Investment in Microfinance Program (LIM) and expand inclusive finance to the unbanked and higher-risk, micro business clientele. BACKGROUND Development Challenge Approximately one-fourth of Lebanon's population, more than 1.0 million people, live on $4/day, less than one-fifth of the country's average per capita income. Those people tend to live in remote rural areas where job opportunities and access to municipal and financial services are minimal. Unsurprisingly, these areas were the hardest hit in terms of the refugee influx, which has made living conditions even harder. Growing income disparity, limited job opportunities, due in part to excessive policy constraints to new investments and job creation, and poor public service delivery systems have led to widespread citizen dissatisfaction, thus giving sectarian organizations an opportunity to gain a foothold in the population in exchange for political-confessional loyalty. To the extent possible, this project will seek opportunities in these vulnerable groups. Among these groups, women, youth, and people with disabilities are largely excluded and underserved when it comes to economic empowerment and access to basic financial services. The unemployment rate for persons with disabilities globally is much higher than non-disabled individuals. Lebanon has an excellent reputation for maintaining high international standards and sound policies in the banking and the financial sector. However, the lack of key conducive policies impedes access to finance and technology by the poor and by low-income micro enterprises (MEs). Also, MEs located in hard-to reach areas experiencing conflict and political instability fare worse. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has developed a Microfinance Index, which ranks countries based on their ability to develop and expand microfinance services. In 2014, the EIU ranked Lebanon 50th among 55 countries examined, based on its microfinance index. In 2011 only 37% of the population (over age 15) had an account at a formal financial institution. For women in particular, this percentage was lower at 25.9% according to the Global Partnership on Financial Inclusion. Thus, there is a clear need for greater financial inclusion in Lebanon, specifically in rural areas where unemployment exceeds 40%. Inadequate and ineffective government regulation concerning microfinance and the sub-optimal delivery of financial and business services have led to uneven access to finance and unbalanced economic growth. Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) comprise approximately 95% of Lebanese-owned businesses, employ from two to ten persons, mainly draw upon household family members, and borrow at levels of less than $17,000. In contrast, low-income rural microenterprises borrow at much lower levels ($500 - $ 1,700) due to: less borrowing capacity; scarcity of commercial credit at favorable terms and in sufficiently large loan amounts that would support growth; limited technical know-how at the enterprise level and basic business skills; and a non-inclusive financial landscape. (1) Not unlike other countries, where the rural population and microenterprises can access lending, microfinance in Lebanon typically has higher rates, shorter terms, and requires high collateral. Compounding this issue, the steady influx of Syrian refugees - estimated at more than 1.5 million, approximately 30% of Lebanon's population, increases competition for scarce rural jobs and threatens political and social stability. The availability of microfinance and related entrepreneurial development skills and innovation, provides low-income and poor rural households with economic opportunities to identify new income sources and generate additional income. These essential services are often not available to persons with disabilities for a variety of reasons including physical barriers (i.e. inaccessible buildings and information), institutional barriers (i.e. discriminatory policy or standards), and attitudes/social barriers (i.e. stigma and discrimination at various levels, refusal to provide services). While the Central Bank has approved mobile payments and banks have started to introduce mobile money transfers, these services are presently only available to middle and high-income segments of the business population. High transaction costs associated with loan repayments, the absence of policies conducive to financial inclusion, and the lack of a specialized capacity within the regulatory agencies to foster and accelerate the pace of growth of the microfinance sector continue to impede performance of the sector. Present efforts to expand inclusive finance in Lebanon are overwhelmingly limited to the provision of microcredit and support for the adoption and scaling-up of best practices. Furthermore, efforts to expand the adoption of new technologies and innovative products in the financial sector are lacking. As a consequence, the financial enabling environment, level of development and competition in the microfinance sector is low, resulting in Lebanon's low microfinance index ranking. Also, inadequate support for women entrepreneurs widens the gender gap, slows development, and misses an opportunity to stabilize and bolster the resiliency of rural communities for coping with stress. This is especially noticeable in conflict prone areas where, ironically, women are counted on to rebuild their communities, strengthen household resiliency, and provide for the well-being of their families. MFIs, NGOs, business associations, and other key stakeholders individually do not have the technical, institutional, and financial ability to effectively advocate for policy changes in the microfinance sector. Needed policy reforms include: 1) enabling MFIs to accept savings deposits from their members or develop innovative ways for members to accumulate savings; 2) allowing MFIs to borrow from commercial banks or from the Central Bank to widen and deepen their financial intermediation role and expand their capital and lending base; 3) facilitating sharing of credit information on cross-over borrowing through privately owned and operated credit bureau information exchanges; and, 4) broadening MFIs' capacities, as well as other institutions, to provide financial inclusion type services that offer new opportunities for low income family micro businesses to improve their livelihoods and resiliency. Such reforms would reduce barriers to growth and development of the sector bringing Lebanon's microfinance sector up to par with other countries in the Levant. Moreover, MFIs need assistance to evolve into profit making entities, and develop on-lending arrangements with commercial banks or other international lending facilities to better support the microfinance sector with best practices. Currently and over the near to medium future, the MFIs are the only institutions that can provide the financial services to micro businesses and low-income households. The rural poor, particularly women, youth, and the physically impaired, and many of the low income or microenterprise businesses do not have a source or means to improve and advance their entrepreneurship skills or learn best practices as formal educational institutions do not provide continuing education opportunities to low income households or informal microenterprise owners. Lebanon must expand its inclusive finance in order to expand its microfinance sector to be on the same plane with global best practices. To illustrate, only 37% of the population (over age 15) had an account at a formal financial institution in 2011, and women and youth (aged between 18 and 35) comprise a large percentage of microenterprise borrowers.(2) The history of microfinance shows that innovations will stem from supply side insights together with a fresh in-depth understanding of the financial lives of poor households. Due to the small number of sustainable MFIs, lack of regulation governing the microfinance sector, and a proliferation of low-cost approaches for disseminating improved and affordable technologies and services, there is substantial room for progress towards greater financial inclusion in Lebanon. For instance, mobile banking, online money transfers and greater application of digitalization can reduce costs and increase the quality of services significantly in Lebanon. From the supply side, financial inclusion and microfinance are means to advance opportunities for microenterprises in rural areas of Lebanon. Looking at the demand side, i.e. individuals and/or microenterprises in rural areas of Lebanon, there exists a good portion of these who do not even qualify for financial services offered by the above-mentioned institutions due to lack of collateral and steady income. This group includes high risk rural, unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired. Microfinance or financial inclusion support for this group is not effective. The type of support needed at this end is a ""jump-start"" or ""livelihoods"" support that will first make these individuals or microenterprises productive and economically viable and then at a later stage bring them in the financial ecosystem. Lebanon's, physiography, hydrology, and well-developed rural-urban market linkages demonstrate promise for economic growth opportunities especially within the low-income rural areas. Furthermore, Lebanon is endowed with temperate and tropical climatic conditions suited to the cultivation of a diverse range of fruit, vegetable, grain, and niche market crops, and livestock. Its abundant coastal marine resources and fisheries, a relatively well-maintained physical infrastructure throughout the country, significant irrigated and high-input agricultural production systems, and proven Lebanese entrepreneurship hold promise for robust economic growth, especially in the rural areas (3). OBJECTIVE The LIFE project is comprised of three components: 1) Inclusive Finance that will elevate the microfinance discourse by bringing about key policy and institutional changes with the potential to transform the financial inclusion landscape - a proven approach for developing a vibrant, sustainable microfinance sector and economically empowering the unbanked, low-income, and underserved micro clientele; 2) Microcredit that will strengthen the capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the Lebanese Microfinance Association (LMA) to increase their range of products and services and expand their reach of borrowers to include microenterprises with an emphasis on higher-risk, conflict affected areas (areas where economic pressures and social tensions have increased significantly as a result of the high influx of refugees), including new, unbanked, and existing microenterprises, and low-income women-headed households. LIFE will provide customized business management training, technical know-how, mentoring, basic business development skills, and new lending products to the MFI's current and potential clientele; and 3) Livelihoods that will provide grant support and basic business training to microenterprises and individuals that are excluded from the financial ecosystem and economic value chains, but because of lack of collateral and steady income or revenues, are considered too high of a credit risk to qualify for microcredit from the MFIs. The purpose of these grants, along with business development services, is to give these microenterprises the chance to grow and become potential MFI clients. This group includes high risk rural poor, including unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired and certain microenterprises. The contractor will identify and propose the appropriate and capable stakeholders to receive USAID assistance. Potential stakeholders and counterparts may include, but are not limited to: the LMA, MFIs, Commercial Banks, the Central Bank of Lebanon, local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), new and established microenterprises, Kafalat (a local guarantee provider), etc. The LIFE project is expected to target all regions in rural areas of Lebanon, with special emphasis on areas labeled ""host communities"", which are currently hosting a large number of refugees (4). STATEMENT OF WORK Overview of Components and Technical Approach LIFE is premised on the development hypothesis that the livelihoods of Lebanon's poorest people will improve significantly only if they can access support services of two kinds, financial and non-financial. LIFE will therefore take steps to make both kinds of services more readily available to the country's marginalized populations, matching the services to the specific business problems clients' face. In other words, LIFE will not be a set of solutions looking for a problem, but a project that tailors its solutions to the problems actually encountered by poor people. That said, USAID's experience under LIM and more generally suggests that finance is indeed a major constraint to Lebanon's poor significantly increasing their incomes. For that reason, it is anticipated that LIFE will devote a substantial proportion of its resources to questions of finance on both the program and policy front. Therefore, if: 1) targeted state and non-state institutions act to create the enabling environment for a more inclusive finance landscape; 2) regulations and guidelines to implement the policy are developed; and 3) staff is trained to carry out the existing and new policies, then it is quite plausible that access to microcredit, microbusiness development services, and technical skills and mentoring in areas of both technical and financial aspects of microbusiness development will increase. Such an improvement in the finance and information symmetry will help to bring out the concept of national financial inclusiveness for supporting broad-based economic growth. At the same time, demand for microfinance service and entrepreneurial development services will increase significantly as has been demonstrated worldwide. Increased availability of efficient microfinance service delivery entities will result in a more dynamic and robust business environment for microbusinesses to grow and flourish. This will lead to increased employment, increased demand for improved service delivery systems for continuing entrepreneurship education for low-income households and micro-businesses to improve their productivity and added value to a changing market. A cycle will thus be initiated in which steadily increasing demand for effective and efficient financial service delivery results in improved service delivery, which in turn results in greater supply and availability, and quality services that are competitively priced. This premise is supported by microfinance-specific literature that is replete with examples of the critical importance of a ""national financial inclusion"" strategy and actions for improving microfinance access by low-income, rural microenterprises and economically marginalized households in particular (5) . It will be recalled that Lebanon's unbanked population (aged 15 and over and without access to financial intermediation comprise 37% of the population and operate the majority of businesses that employ only two family members) are starved for working capital and lack the skills and knowledge for adopting best entrepreneurial practices and innovation. This approach reflects the June 2011 call from USAID Administrator Shah that ""USAID's efforts must be grounded in a deeper understanding of the words ""country ownership"" that encompasses not simply government in its approach, but the gamut of stakeholders, including the end users themselves."" The overall purpose of the LIFE project is to contribute to the achievement of USAID/Lebanon's stated goal of ""increased access to finance, especially for new business start-ups and women entrepreneurs and enhance entrepreneurs' business skills."" More specifically, LIFE's efforts will result in the outcome ""strengthened micro-finance association and member institutions."" Toward this end, LIFE will, in light of the positive mid-term evaluation of the LIM program, implement the recommendations by further strengthening the capacity of NGOs that will be engaged in providing customized hands-on training and mentorship of microenterprises. Emphasis will be on the underserved and hard-to-reach microenterprises, and new microenterprise start-ups in higher-risk and conflict affected areas including women led low-income rural households. Also, LIFE will facilitate, nurture, and strengthen a network of institutions and stakeholders aimed at providing sustainable support to microenterprise development and inclusive finance support. Microenterprises and entrepreneurs that qualify for microcredit will be the targeted beneficiaries under the microcredit component. High risk, low income or unemployed rural women and youth, as well as microenterprises that do not qualify for microcredit from the MFIs will be the target beneficiaries of the Livelihoods component and eligible for grant support and technical training. The LIFE project will build on the initial successes and lessons of the LIM initiative and advance the goals of improving livelihoods, supporting microfinance activity, and expanding national financial inclusion of the unbanked and low-income households under the following three components: 1) Inclusive Finance will aim to bring about a minimum of three significant policy/institutional changes that will bring many more clients into the financial ecosystem and expand national financial inclusion- an essential element for developing a vibrant, sustainable microfinance sector and economically empowering the unbanked, low-income, and underserved micro clientele; 2) Microcredit will strengthen the capacity of MFI's and LMA to increase their range of products and services and to expand their reach of borrowers to include microenterprises with an emphasis on higher-risk, conflict affected areas (areas where economic pressures and social tensions have increased significantly as a result of the high influx of refugees) including new, unbanked, and existing microenterprises, and low-income women-headed households. LIFE will provide customized business management training, technical know-how, mentoring, basic business development skills, and new lending products to the MFI's current and potential clients; and 3) Livelihoods will provide grant support and basic business training to individuals and microenterprises who would like to participate in the financial ecosystem and economic value chains, but who, because of lack of collateral and steady income, are considered too high of a credit risk to qualify for microcredit from the MFIs. This group includes high risk rural, unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired. Component 1: Inclusive Finance Microfinance is the means to achieving the inclusive finance objective. Microfinance includes the full range of financial services offered in any financial ecosystem, such as savings, funds transfers, payments, credit histories and credit scoring, warehouse receipts, insurance and credit. Because microcredit is critically important to microfinance, and to build on the achievements of the LIM project in this area, microcredit is included as a separate stand-alone component below. The primary objective of the ‘Inclusive Finance"" component is to bring about a minimum of three significant policy/institutional changes that would expand national financial inclusion. USAID/ Lebanon conducted an assessment of the overall microfinance landscape and the following four key policy/institutional changes emerged as top priorities to expand financial inclusion: • enable MFIs to accept savings deposits from their members; • allow borrowing from commercial banks or the Central Bank to widen and deepen the financial intermediation role of MFIs and expand their capital and lending base; • facilitate sharing of credit information on cross-over borrowing through privately operated credit bureau information exchanges; and • Broaden MFIs' capacities to provide financial inclusion type services that offer new opportunities for low income family micro businesses to improve their livelihoods and resiliency. Out of these four findings, it is realistic to assume that the last three changes above can be implemented under the LIFE program. If implemented, these reforms could result in significant numbers of currently marginalized Lebanese entering the financial ecosystem and benefiting from opportunities to engage in productive activities and earn more income. This component will work closely with the Central Bank, LMA, and MFIs to translate the reforms from ideas into reality. The relevant literature on microfinance emphasizes the critical importance of national financial inclusion in improving access to financial services for microenterprises and individuals who are excluded from the financial sector (6). Financial inclusion clearly defines and aligns a shared vision among policy makers, MFIs, and other stakeholders for achieving an inclusive financial sector. It represents a shared vision of the role microfinance can play in a country's development and increase people's access to financial services. These strategies are nationally-owned and developed in a consultative process with key stakeholders. The process is policy/institutional changes that outline strategies, approaches, and actions to expand access of poor and low income people to finance services. The LIFE project will provide technical assistance and support to the LMA and the Central Bank to work on these policy/institutional changes. Component 2: Microcredit This component will provide support to microfinance institutions and the LMA with the aim of increasing microcredit products and services available for microenterprises and entrepreneurs in niche markets where access to credit is not readily available. Similar to LIM, this component will work on capitalizing MFIs in order for them to provide new targeted microfinance products and services and provide them with technical assistance that is essential for developing these products. This strategic approach is consistent with a key LIM evaluation recommendation ""to target higher-risk categories of potential borrowers to be specifically reached by a portion of sub-grant funds or underwritten through a credit guarantee."" In other words, should a credit guarantee scheme be used, it would be mainly for MFIs to raise additional funding from banks, with the USG as a guarantor. Technical assistance under this component will also target loan recipients. This component will also emphasize conflict-affected areas of high unemployment and high numbers of unbanked individuals. The difference between activity under this component and activity under LIM is this component targets beneficiaries better through greater outreach. This component's activities will support the microfinance sector while at the same time expand financial inclusion, one of the main aims of the program. This component aims to increase access to finance by the unbanked, hard-to-reach borrowers by the end of the program. As a corollary, and in aggregate, it is expected that the lending capital portfolio dedicated to higher-risk, underserved microbusinesses increases by several-fold throughout the project period, with commercial banks providing a significant share of the additional lending capital. Under this component, assistance will be compliant with ADS 219, which specifies conditions to delivering assistance to MFIs. Component 3: Livelihoods This component will provide grant support and training to individuals who are currently excluded from the financial sector's products and services who do not meet the requirements for receiving loans from the MFIs. There is a large group of potential entrepreneurs and microenterprises which does not qualify for microloans from the MFIs -even those with credit guarantees and other credit enhancements, because they lack the collateral and stable income necessary to secure and enable repayment of the loans. This group includes many of the rural poor including low income or unemployed women, youth, and physically impaired. LIFE will strive to link individuals and microenterprises in this target population into economic value chains and bring them into the financial ecosystem by providing them with market-linkage grants and basic business training. The assistance package may include customized technical and soft business development skills training and mentoring as well as limited market linkage grants for investment capital to enable potential entrepreneurs and microenterprises to acquire small pieces of capital equipment. Existing commercial training modules will be administered by organizations that specialize in providing entrepreneurial and basic business development technical skills training and mentorship across various small-scale enterprises of relevance to the Lebanese rural landscape and urban markets. A series of focused thematic training totaling about 50 hours of training per individual administered over a series of weeks. The project will identify NGOs that cater to filling these needs and are exclusive to the MFI partners involved with the microfinance aspects of the project. Assistance under this component is mainly aimed at improving livelihoods through increased income and/or increased employment. --- (1) UNHCR is constantly updating a risk classification of areas in Lebanon based on the number of hosted registered refugees (2) The U.S. Library of Congress (3) The Agricultural Sector of Lebanon, UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Beirut, Lebanon, October 1, 2013 (4) UNHCR is constantly updating a risk classification of areas in Lebanon based on the number of hosted registered refugees (5) The New Microfinance Handbook, a Financial Market System Perspective, edited by Joanna Ledgerwood with Julie Earne and Candace Nelson, the World Bank 2013.

Introduction USAID/Burma is the Agency's newest mission; it was established in November 2012. Still in its infancy and still very much in start-up mode, the mission has grown from a staff of 3 or 4, to a staffing plan total of 71 positions. Of those 71 positions 38 are filled with either permanent staff or long term temporary fills until the permanent staff members arrive. Alongside a growth in staff, the mission has also experienced a growth in its budget to over $100 million, and it is reasonably expected to continue growing. II. Nature of Services Required The Mission seeks professional services which will achieve the following objectives: • Increase staff effectiveness through shared understanding of interpersonal and team dynamics; • Strengthen leadership behaviors, skills and approaches of all staff ; • Support continuous Mission-wide strategic planning, communications and operational improvement efforts; and • Boost staff morale and cohesion through informal, off-site interaction. A mission-wide retreat was conducted in April 2015. It is expected that all of the above objectives should build upon, and be continuation of the outcomes, findings and successes of the previous retreat. A. Approach USAID/Burma requests that organizational development services offered incorporate the following characteristics, which it believes to be critical to the successful achievement of the aforementioned objectives: • Highly participatory, interactive and experiential for all participants • Incorporates current and best practices in organizational development, customized to high-stress start-up organizations • Builds upon advance data collection (in the form of a Mission-wide survey) and organizational assessment, designed to inform service provision • Appropriately balances strategic planning, process improvement and operational orientation with that of inter-personal effectiveness, teambuilding • Is specifically tailored to USAID Burma's organizational culture • Facilitates personalization/unique experiences for participants (as opposed to a generalized ‘one size fits all'), and • Provides forward-looking recommendations for ongoing collaboration, skill-building and enhanced individual and team performance in the Mission (as provided by this offeror or others) USAID Burma requests the offeror to apply these characteristics to the following services, as part of an integrated approach to organizational development for the performance of this contract. B. Retreat USAID/Burma will host a retreat, informed by pre-retreat consultations, and diagnostics (via survey, focus group or key informant interviews) as incorporated in the preparation and planning process. Duties include: • Completing initial surveys and accompanying analysis for all staff • A prioritization on enabling follow-up and operationalization for any action items, individual or shared commitments made during the course of the retreat itself • A particular focus on inclusion, ensuring all voices are heard, including those that may be more reticent or contrary • Facilitating a frank but positive/constructive dialogue among staff, with an emphasis on problem-solving, individual responsibility and empowerment • Consistent reinforcement of the Mission's (and Agency's) emphasis on leadership behavior and development, explicit values Specific activities for each retreat session would be designed based upon initial consultations with Mission-wide staff, as well as proposed needs assessments and/or diagnostics as proposed by the facilitator(s) to gather additional background information on potential issues and areas for further development. Illustrative activities include: • Scenarios, role play or other innovative activities focused on teambuilding, identifying and strengthening shared values, and related organizational development at the team level • Exercises, facilitated discussion designed to improve communications within a given team (or sub-unit) and with other units in the Mission • Review of achievements in implementing the Mission-wide strategy and other key initiatives • Defining team work objectives that support the multi-year Mission strategy • Addressing workload and time management issues specific to the team • Developing operational enhancements to key business processes that can improve efficiency or quality of team outputs, results C. Data collection and analysis The Mission proposes the provider conduct critical pre-event data collection to serve as input for the retreat design, and requests approaches to maximize the value while minimizing staff time required to provide that input. This may take the form of interviews, surveys, focus group discussions or other methods. In addition to retreats, USAID anticipates the possible need for other data collection and analysis that might further support organizational development through the utilization of Mission ‘temperature checks' gauging staff views and experiences, for example. These will be outlined at the time they are identified. D. Scope of Work to be Performed Over the duration of this contract, it is anticipated the offeror will complete the following tasks, as requested and in achievement of the overall objectives: 1. Data collection and analysis of Mission-wide survey: Conduct the necessary survey for all staff, as well as compile and analyze results of the survey. 2. Design, conduct and/or analyze organizational diagnostic of Mission staff: In designing the retreat events, facilitators should propose a process by which key data related to organizational dynamics, team and Mission-wide issues are identified for prioritization in the agenda. This will include review of existing documentation related to organizational development efforts, as well as those that may be currently underway. Specifically, offerors should propose a survey, focus group, informant interviews (or other tool) that requires minimal time commitment from staff, while providing critical input into agenda design. 3. Retreat Planning: Work with a Mission Retreat Committee to convert diagnostic information into a retreat agenda that meets the stated objectives, as outlined above. Compile appropriate tools, resources, methodologies for all sessions. 4. Logistics management: Work with the Mission's Retreat Committee and administrative team to coordinate all retreat logistics and preparations. Ensure all necessary materials and audio/visual equipment are on-site for the successful execution of the retreat. 5. Retreat evaluation: Given guidance from the Mission Retreat Committee, develop, implement and analyze the results of an event-wide Evaluation tool. The aim of this tool will be to capture staff impressions and experiences to inform future retreat events, but also inform Mission leadership as to key issues that are identified resulting from retreat sessions. 6. Retreat report: Produce a comprehensive report from the retreat event that summarizes the findings of the pre-event diagnostic, activities undertaken during the event, detailed notes from all sessions (for Team Leaders and staff to reference), as well as synthesized results from the post-event Evaluation tool and recommendations for future events or interim activities, priorities or issues for Mission leadership. III. Schedule Over the duration of this contract, USAID Burma anticipates services to be requested according to the following four day schedule from November 7 - 10, 2016. • Data collection & analysis - 3-weeks before and leading up to the retreat. • Overall Retreat - The retreat will be conducted over 4 days. This will be composed of:: o Mission wide retreat - 1.5 days of Mission-wide plenary sessions, supplemented by break-out sessions targeting specific teams or groups. o Office Retreats - 3 days of retreats with individual offices. USAID/Burma is composed of 7 Offices, each of which would have a ½ or whole day retreat in the lead up to the mission wide retreat. In no circumstance will the length of the retreat exceed a total of 4 days. • Retreat evaluation and report - 3-weeks after retreat. IV. Oversight and Support USAID/Burma will provide primary oversight for the agreement, including all services provided. Designated staff from USAID/Burma will be responsible for reviewing, vetting and approving all deliverables in a timely manner. Approval and/or comments will be provided within 3 business days of receipt. Other ad hoc or working committees will be established for other services provided by the contractor as determined through the management of this contract. In addition to oversight, the following support may be available from USAID/Burma, depending upon the retreat activities as contracted: • Photocopies and limited document reproduction services. • Stationary and office supplies for the event. • Projector and laptop(s) for presentations during the event. • Identification and procurement of retreat venue, including meals/refreshments for USAID employees and facilitators during the retreat. • Local transport of contractor and staff as needed between USAID offices, and retreat venue as required. For all on-site work, the contractor shall arrange its own transportation to and from the USAID offices and pay directly for boarding and lodging costs. V. Level of Effort The Level of Effort is anticipated to maximize synergies and cost savings across the package of services requested. The LOE will be for the breakdown below but is subject to the specific retreat content; • prepare for the retreat, • to deliver the retreat, and • to complete the post-retreat reports.

Introduction USAID/Burma is the Agency's newest mission; it was established in November 2012. Still in its infancy and still very much in start-up mode, the mission has grown from a staff of 3 or 4, to a staffing plan total of 71 positions. Of those 71 positions 38 are filled with either permanent staff or long term temporary fills until the permanent staff members arrive. Alongside a growth in staff, the mission has also experienced a growth in its budget to over $100 million, and it is reasonably expected to continue growing. II. Nature of Services Required The Mission seeks professional services which will achieve the following objectives: • Increase staff effectiveness through shared understanding of interpersonal and team dynamics; • Strengthen leadership behaviors, skills and approaches of all staff ; • Support continuous Mission-wide strategic planning, communications and operational improvement efforts; and • Boost staff morale and cohesion through informal, off-site interaction. A mission-wide retreat was conducted in April 2015. It is expected that all of the above objectives should build upon, and be continuation of the outcomes, findings and successes of the previous retreat. A. Approach USAID/Burma requests that organizational development services offered incorporate the following characteristics, which it believes to be critical to the successful achievement of the aforementioned objectives: • Highly participatory, interactive and experiential for all participants • Incorporates current and best practices in organizational development, customized to high-stress start-up organizations • Builds upon advance data collection (in the form of a Mission-wide survey) and organizational assessment, designed to inform service provision • Appropriately balances strategic planning, process improvement and operational orientation with that of inter-personal effectiveness, teambuilding • Is specifically tailored to USAID Burma's organizational culture • Facilitates personalization/unique experiences for participants (as opposed to a generalized ‘one size fits all'), and • Provides forward-looking recommendations for ongoing collaboration, skill-building and enhanced individual and team performance in the Mission (as provided by this offeror or others) USAID Burma requests the offeror to apply these characteristics to the following services, as part of an integrated approach to organizational development for the performance of this contract. B. Retreat USAID/Burma will host a retreat, informed by pre-retreat consultations, and diagnostics (via survey, focus group or key informant interviews) as incorporated in the preparation and planning process. Duties include: • Completing initial surveys and accompanying analysis for all staff • A prioritization on enabling follow-up and operationalization for any action items, individual or shared commitments made during the course of the retreat itself • A particular focus on inclusion, ensuring all voices are heard, including those that may be more reticent or contrary • Facilitating a frank but positive/constructive dialogue among staff, with an emphasis on problem-solving, individual responsibility and empowerment • Consistent reinforcement of the Mission's (and Agency's) emphasis on leadership behavior and development, explicit values Specific activities for each retreat session would be designed based upon initial consultations with Mission-wide staff, as well as proposed needs assessments and/or diagnostics as proposed by the facilitator(s) to gather additional background information on potential issues and areas for further development. Illustrative activities include: • Scenarios, role play or other innovative activities focused on teambuilding, identifying and strengthening shared values, and related organizational development at the team level • Exercises, facilitated discussion designed to improve communications within a given team (or sub-unit) and with other units in the Mission • Review of achievements in implementing the Mission-wide strategy and other key initiatives • Defining team work objectives that support the multi-year Mission strategy • Addressing workload and time management issues specific to the team • Developing operational enhancements to key business processes that can improve efficiency or quality of team outputs, results C. Data collection and analysis The Mission proposes the provider conduct critical pre-event data collection to serve as input for the retreat design, and requests approaches to maximize the value while minimizing staff time required to provide that input. This may take the form of interviews, surveys, focus group discussions or other methods. In addition to retreats, USAID anticipates the possible need for other data collection and analysis that might further support organizational development through the utilization of Mission ‘temperature checks' gauging staff views and experiences, for example. These will be outlined at the time they are identified. D. Scope of Work to be Performed Over the duration of this contract, it is anticipated the offeror will complete the following tasks, as requested and in achievement of the overall objectives: 1. Data collection and analysis of Mission-wide survey: Conduct the necessary survey for all staff, as well as compile and analyze results of the survey. 2. Design, conduct and/or analyze organizational diagnostic of Mission staff: In designing the retreat events, facilitators should propose a process by which key data related to organizational dynamics, team and Mission-wide issues are identified for prioritization in the agenda. This will include review of existing documentation related to organizational development efforts, as well as those that may be currently underway. Specifically, offerors should propose a survey, focus group, informant interviews (or other tool) that requires minimal time commitment from staff, while providing critical input into agenda design. 3. Retreat Planning: Work with a Mission Retreat Committee to convert diagnostic information into a retreat agenda that meets the stated objectives, as outlined above. Compile appropriate tools, resources, methodologies for all sessions. 4. Logistics management: Work with the Mission's Retreat Committee and administrative team to coordinate all retreat logistics and preparations. Ensure all necessary materials and audio/visual equipment are on-site for the successful execution of the retreat. 5. Retreat evaluation: Given guidance from the Mission Retreat Committee, develop, implement and analyze the results of an event-wide Evaluation tool. The aim of this tool will be to capture staff impressions and experiences to inform future retreat events, but also inform Mission leadership as to key issues that are identified resulting from retreat sessions. 6. Retreat report: Produce a comprehensive report from the retreat event that summarizes the findings of the pre-event diagnostic, activities undertaken during the event, detailed notes from all sessions (for Team Leaders and staff to reference), as well as synthesized results from the post-event Evaluation tool and recommendations for future events or interim activities, priorities or issues for Mission leadership. III.

This will be composed of:: o Mission wide retreat - 1.5 days of Mission-wide plenary sessions, supplemented by break-out sessions targeting specific teams or groups. o Office Retreats - 3 days of retreats with individual offices. USAID/Burma is composed of 7 Offices, each of which would have a ½ or whole day retreat in the lead up to the mission wide retreat.

"Broad-Agency-Announcement-GLOBAL-HEALTH-2016","Broad-Agency-Announcement-GLOBAL-HEALTH-2016","The USAID Broad Agency Announcement for Global Health Challenges I.                   Overview A.         This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks opportunities to co-create, co-design, co-invest, and collaborate in the research, development, piloting, testing, and scaling of innovative, practical and cost-effective interventions to address the most pressing problems in global health. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) invites organizations and companies to participate with USAID, in cooperation with its partners, to generate novel tools and approaches that accelerate and sustain improved health outcomes in developing countries.  B.         Federal Agency Name: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) C.         Opportunity Title: The USAID Global Health Challenge BAA D.         Opportunity Number:  Broad-Agency-Announcement-GLOBAL-HEALTH-2016 F.         Authority: This BAA is issued under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 35.016 (c). This is not a FAR Part 15 Procurement. G.         Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 98.001 USAID Foreign Assistance Programs for Overseas. PROBLEM: The global community has made great strides in reducing mortality around the world over the last 50 years, but progress in developing countries lags far behind that seen in developed countries. Every year an estimated 303,000 women die during pregnancy and childbirth, 5.9 million children die, and an even greater number become infected with life-threatening diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and TB, among others. The vast majority of deaths due to these largely preventable causes occur in developing countries where access to health services is often poor. Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases like Ebola and Zika only serve to further compound these health challenges, taxing already stressed health systems and elevating the risk of disease epidemics of global proportions. CHALLENGE: Harness the power of science, technology, and innovation to generate new knowledge, tools, and approaches that can reduce developing country mortality down to the levels of more developed countries within a generation. USAID and partners will work to rapidly implement solutions and create an environment for sustainability, scalability, and ultimately health impact.  Criteria for Consideration A.         Initial submissions are not evaluated against other submissions, but solely whether USAID believes that the submitter will be a valuable contributor to the co-creation process.  USAID may need to limit the number of initial submissions selected to move forward based on efficiencies. B.         Concept Papers are not evaluated against other submissions, but solely based on USAID’s determination that the Concept Paper will successfully address the Problem and Challenges set forth herein. USAID may need to limit the number of Concept Papers selected to move forward based on efficiencies. C.         Decisions regarding USAID’s pursuit of a particular project, technology or relationship are based on the available evidence, data, and resulting analysis. USAID seeks solutions that have a significant impact (i.e. breakthroughs, not incremental improvements), and can achieve that impact at scale. D.         The reputations of an organization, its past performance, the managerial and technical ability of the person or team of people engaged in the endeavor are always significant considerations in assessing the potential and the risks associated with each award. E.         Additional criteria that may be considered under this BAA to indicate that the submission successfully addresses the Problem and Challenges will be specified in each Addendum. Award Stages. The amount of resources made available under this BAA will depend on the Addenda issued, concepts received, and the availability of funds.  Some award types may not include any funding.  The award process under this BAA generally has the following steps: Expression of Interest; Development of the Concept Paper; Review by the Peer and Scientific Review Board; Contracting/Agreement Officer Determination, Review, Negotiation and Award.

"SOL-656-16-000012","INTEGRATED MALARIA PROGRAM (IMaP)","The US Agency for International Development (USAID) Mozambique intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for the project entitled ""Integrated Malaria Program"" (IMaP) under USAID/Mozambique's Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI). The activity aligns strategically with Mozambique's National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP). IMaP will strengthen the Ministry of Health's (MoH) capacity to implement the NMSP at national, provincial, district, and community levels. The project will strengthen partnerships with communities, civil society, health facilities, District Health Directorates (DDS), Provincial Health Directorates (DPS), the private sector, and cooperating partners to scale up and maintain internationally accepted strategies to fight malaria. Synopsis: IMaP will contribute to reduce malaria mortality, morbidity, and parasitemia in targeted provinces, thereby supporting USAID Mozambique's Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) Development Objective 4 - Health status of target populations improved. The activities included in this design contribute to the Intermediate Result 4.1 - Coverage of high impact health and nutrition services increased. This will be achieved by increasing utilization and uptake of quality malaria prevention and control interventions. The two principal modes for the provision of malaria services are the facility and community levels. The activities will address all three sub-results shown in Figure 1 by improving the quality of implementation and use of facility and community-based malaria services and by strengthening the data flow between these systems.

"SOL-674-16-000029","Senior Technical Advisor for Strategic Information","An estimated 6.6 million South Africans are infected with HIV, the highest number in any country in the world. The country is also significantly affected by a related tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. The Health Office manages one of the largest President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program in the world, as well TB activities funded from USAID's account. USAID/SA funding for health programs is expected to exceed $200 million in FY 2016. The Health Office has grown rapidly from 12 staff in 2007 to over 46 staff in 2016; the Office collaborates closely with other United States Government (USG) agencies to implement PEPFAR, especially the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health Office staff are active participants in PEPFAR policy and program design, and often chair interagency technical working groups on a range of health-related issues. In this third, five-year phase of the program, PEPFAR/South Africa is oriented toward strategic partnership with all levels of the South African Government (SAG), with an emphasis on epidemic control, DREAMS, health systems strengthening, and cost efficiencies. The Partnership Framework embodies this new strategic direction and emphasizes the alignment of PEPFAR/SA and SAG information and reporting systems. Enhancing the availability, quality, and use of Strategic Information (SI) for both PEPFAR/SA and the SAG are fundamental to achieving success in these areas.

"AID-656-FTFVC","USAID/Mozambique – Feed the Future Mozambique Value Chain (FTF VC) Activity","Agency/Office: Overseas Missions Location: USAID Mozambique Title: USAID/Mozambique - Feed the Future Mozambique Value Chain (FTF VC) Activity The U.S. Mission in Mozambique established a Country Development and Cooperation Strategy1 and performance monitoring plan for all U.S. government activities to ensure that results are being achieved. Development Objective 2 is a ""Resilient, Broad-based Economic Growth Accelerated."" A key Intermediate Result for achieving this Development Objective is ""Increased Agricultural Sector Growth and Food Security in Focus Provinces with Emphasis on Women."" The FTF VC activity will contribute towards this intermediate result. The focus of FTF VC will be on improving the productivity and profitability of targeted value chains2. FTF VC will use interventions that facilitate improvements in how markets function without taking over functions within the market. FTF VC will be a five-year contract, commencing in approximately September 2017, with a total estimated cost of $22-$23 million. The activity will focus on the 26 districts included in the Feed the Future Zone of Influence (ZOI). The ZOI was previously 23 districts but new districts have been created by sub-dividing old districts. The target population and geographic area remain the same from the baseline study3. The contractor will be expected to provide wide-ranging consultant services to identify end- market opportunities and link value chain actors to identified opportunities, strengthen vertical and horizontal linkages and relationships in selected value chains, and strengthen input supply and other supporting services and improve farmer access to these interconnected markets. Objective: Develop inclusive, self-sustaining agricultural markets which increase incomes for Mozambican farmers. Illustrative list of deliverables: a) Provision of market analysis for selected value chains, including an end market analysis b) Production of causal models and theory of change for each selected value chain c) Completion of a baseline survey for each selected value chain d) Production of strategic frameworks for each value chain, including interventions, targets, and exit strategy e) Implementation of interventions within strategic frameworks f) Development of a performance monitoring plan including systematic change indicators and Feed the Future standard indicators4 g) Development of a knowledge capture system for tacit and explicit knowledge h) Development of quantitative and qualitative data collection tools  Illustrative example of potential contractor services: The USAID-funded Zambia Production, Finance and Improved Technologies5 (PROFIT) program increased incomes for 143,000 farmers of maize, beans, and groundnut by 273%. Instead of working directly with farmers, the project identified market participants, including commercial input suppliers, which viewed farmers as potential customers and therefore saw a win-win relationship with farmers. Input suppliers saw that if farmers' yields and profits increased then their need for additional products would increase. Even with this potential, input suppliers faced inherent risks of trying to provide services in a dispersed network of smallholder farmers. The program used ""smart subsidies""6 to work with the commercial input suppliers to create a cadre of for-profit input supply agents operating in villages and towns. The commercial input suppliers provided product training to the agents along with a supply of inputs and the agents provided feedback from the farmers to the commercial input suppliers. The PROFIT project did not become part of the market by delivering services directly but instead worked with input suppliers and agents to understand their risks and incentives to create an agent network that would last beyond the life of the project. Issuance of this notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis of proposed contract action requirement in FAR 5.201. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, which will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov.

Often new or new ways of relating between actors in a value chain carry substantial perceived risks.

CREATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Guatemala intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an anticipated five-year, cost plus fixed fee contract. The Creating Economic Opportunities Project aims to reduce poverty and improve living conditions, closing gaps between Guatemala and migrant destination countries, in order to decrease unaccompanied child and irregular migration. To achieve this objective, CEO will grow businesses, and increase employment and income generating opportunities for Guatemalans through a multi-pronged approach utilizing four levers of economic development - expanding access to markets, improving workforce capacity, increasing access to financial services, and strengthening the policy and enabling environment. CEO will work to benefit the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable Guatemalans, particularly youth and indigenous persons, in select geographic areas with high levels of out migration (the Western Highlands and the Department of Guatemala). As CEO will partner with local communities to develop market-led local solutions, ""economic opportunity"" will be defined by CEO's beneficiaries. To ensure sustainability and scalability, CEO will then work to contextualize and respond to these definitions of ""economic opportunity"" within the scope of USAID/Guatemala's CDCS long-term development goals and Guatemala's many plans. This project will have the following four components: · Component 1: Access to Market Expanded · Component 2: Workforce Capacity Improved · Component 3: Access to Financial Services Increased · Component 4: Policy and Enabling Environment Strengthened  ","Aug 16, 2016 12:59 AM EDT","Aug 1, 2016","Aug 1, 2016","Presolicitation","Charis Nastoff | Patricia M.

The specific number of days to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and the Mission. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo AREA OF CONSIDERATION: US Citizens I. POSITION DESCRIPTION: A. BACKGROUND The creation of Europe's newest state has proceeded on a forward path despite setbacks. Today, Kosovo functions as a state with an operational government and society after having emerged from a post conflict environment. The 2012 end of ""supervised independence"" and closure of the International Civilian Office (ICO) represented a success and served to highlight the young state's growing maturity and capacity. Government institutions, particularly at the central level, continue to strengthen their operations, and the decentralization of authority to local municipalities reinforces local governance and democratic development. The country has adopted a democratic Constitution, established a Constitutional Court, and has an adequate body of laws and policies, although implementation and enforcement of laws proves poor. Kosovo has held eight peaceful, albeit flawed, elections. Municipal elections were held in the fall of 2013 and parliamentary elections in June 2014. The former resulted in Government of Kosovo mayors and Municipal Assemblies being established in the Serb-majority northern municipalities for the first time, and the latter turned into a six-month political stalemate, only resolved through the formation of a coalition disliked by most of the population. To date, 98 countries have recognized Kosovo, but it still lacks official recognition by many countries. This has prevented Kosovo's membership in the United Nations and other global organizations and has led the European Union to adopt a ""status neutral"" policy towards Kosovo that hampers its ability to fully promote its development. The GoK and the Government of Serbia (GoS) signed an Agreement to Normalize Relations in the spring of 2013 (i.e. ""Brussels Agreement"") and this represents one of Kosovo's most notable international achievements to date. Implementation of the Agreement has been uneven, and only recently has an announcement been made that one of the most integral pieces-the Association of Serb Municipalities-will soon be launched. Serious challenges have arisen in integrating the Kosovo Serb courts in the North into the Kosovo Judiciary despite the February 2015 Justice Sector Agreement, and corruption ranks as one of the biggest problems facing the country. The GoK remains committed to addressing minority issues but faces internal pressures and societal demands that that emphasize the ethnic Albanian character of the state at the expense of minorities and some ultra-nationalists Kosovo Serbs continue to resist integration. Lack of awareness about the Brussels Agreement among the population and inability to have direct dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade further slow progress on ethnic integration. Kosovo has the poorest economy in the region and struggles with high levels of poverty, massive unemployment (estimated at 45%), and over-dependence on imports combined with a very small export sector and energy shortages. The country's Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is estimated at $3,520, ranked 93rd worldwide and behind Macedonia, Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. USAID and other donors have expended considerable investments in assisting the GoK to stand up the institutions of government. To address the challenges discussed above, USAID/Kosovo drafted a Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), FY 2014-FY 2018 to guide USAID assistance efforts in making these institutions more effective. B. USAID/Democracy and Governance (DG) Portfolio Overview: Despite the existence of the institutions of governance, Kosovars voice frustration and impatience with the progress in implementing good governance and the rule of law. The court system remains inefficient and has yet to demonstrate its full independence. The Assembly has proven slow in enacting legislation and exercising oversight of the executive branch. Progress has stalled on the decentralization of power to municipal governments as mandated in the Constitution. USAID believes it critical to start making government work in an accountable and effective manner for the people of Kosovo. Effective and accountable governance will attract foreign investment, increase the country's respect in the international community, and inspire confidence in citizens that they can and should take an active role in their country's development. USAID/Kosovo's CDCS calls for shifting the focus from establishing the foundations for democracy to making democratic governance function. This requires having an impact on the supply and demand sides of democratic governance by helping to make government more effective and open to accountability as well as strengthening the mechanisms through which citizens can represent their interests in government and hold state institutions accountable. This necessitates a substantial investment in assisting the justice system to start delivering justice more efficiently and independently of government influence or corruption. Finally, this strategy requires USAID/Kosovo to have a particular focus on the implementation and accountability of governance at the local level where most of the work of government should occur. The DG portfolio has a multi-sector focus with eighteen programs (contracts, cooperative agreements, grants and government-to-government) and needs a senior level expert who has a broad understanding and experience with the plethora of activities in a DG portfolio. An additional design is planned in FY2017 for local governance, while support is needed on Technical Evaluation Committees, and in office workload management. The position requires an individual who can work independently with minimal supervision, exercise excellent verbal and written skills, apply exemplary planning techniques, support FSN team members, multi-task and prioritize deadlines, and exercise quality control over all documents being sent for approval. In light of the Brussels Agreement, representational responsibilities for this position will take a portion of the Advisor's time and this individual will engage with high level USG, donor and counterpart officials. These officials include the Chair of the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC), the General Secretary for the Ministry of Local Government Administration, the Minister of Justice, various mayors and municipal officials. The portfolio has a number of cross-sector activities with the DG Office teams, Economic Growth teams and participates actively in multiple donor and different USG Mission working groups, including representing USAID on the US Embassy's ROL/Anti-corruption working group and a significant role in the Embassy's Minority Engagement Working Group. Achieving peace and stability in the Balkans through integration of minority groups is the top USG foreign policy priority for this region and will require a senior-level USAID expert with both managerial and technical skills and diplomatic acumen. The USAID Mission in Kosovo is the largest in the Balkan region and is the second largest donor in Kosovo after the European Union (EU). With an active portfolio valued at over $220 million, USAID Kosovo is staffed with 97 positions (13 U. S. Direct Hires [USDHs], 10 U.S. Personal Services Contractors [USPSCs], and 74 Foreign Service Nationals [FSNs]). The Mission also provides legal, contracting, and executive office support services to other USAID missions throughout the Balkan region. USAID's DG Office currently has eleven staff: US Direct Hire (USDH) Office Director; USDH Deputy Director ; two FSN Advisors for Rule of Law; FSN Local Government And Public Administration Specialist; FSN Civil Society and Political Competition Program Manager; FSN Democracy and Governance Program Manager; FSN Program Management Specialist/Engineer; FSN Program Management/Development Assistance Specialist -Team Leader; FSN Project Specialist for Minority Engagement; and FSN Project/Administrative Assistant.

The specific number of days to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and the Mission. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo AREA OF CONSIDERATION: US Citizens I. POSITION DESCRIPTION: BACKGROUND The USAID Mission for Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo), located in Pristina, manages one of the most important and complex assistance programs in the region. In-line with USG and Kosovo priorities, USAID/Kosovo's five-year Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) envisages Kosovo as an effective state, with a viable economy and an inclusive democracy on the path to European integration. The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. Since the end of conflict in Kosovo, USAID has been the key donor in establishing economic policies and a legal and institutional framework in Kosovo. The key institutions, laws, and regulations are generally in place, as is a sound fiscal and financial system. Among the institutions supported by USAID technical assistance were the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK), Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK), the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the Kosovo Pension Savings Trust (KPST), Kosovo Electric Company (Korporata Elektroenergjetike e Kosovës - KEK), Energy Regulatory Office (ERO), Kosovo Veterinary and Food Agency (KVFA), Kosovo Forest Agency (KFA) and others. Much progress has been made in building their capacity. Several, such as the CBK, the KPST, and the privatization agency, now function at a level of proficiency that does not require ongoing donor support. USAID assistance until recently was focused on support for the basic building blocks of an independent Kosovo. For Kosovo to move forward, it needs to establish a clear economic base for development and to consolidate democratic achievements. Consequently, with the new CDCS, USAID assistance is focusing on supporting the private sector, which is best-positioned to determine Kosovo's comparative advantages and best able to increase incomes and jobs. With basic government functions operating with a degree of effectiveness, it is important to ensure that there is a vibrant civil society that is capable of holding the government accountable and demanding rule of law. In addition, USAID has increased its focus on supporting municipalities. Kosovo's central government institutions have achieved remarkable progress in a short period of time. While threats to these gains still remain, support for building the capabilities of local government remain one of the key objectives of USAID assistance in Kosovo. At the center, focus is shifting from establishing institutions to making them functional. Central government institutions still require support to varying degrees of involvement. Over the next five years, the task will be to consolidate and build on successes at the center, and begin to scale back support to those ministries and agencies that are capable of successfully fulfilling their mandate without full-time donor assistance. Support for youth and education is a major new area. Youth-oriented programs play a central role in USAID's portfolio. Youth and education interventions are cross-cutting and based on a strong partnership with the GOK and other stakeholders. A key element of USAID's approach is strong synergies throughout the portfolio to maximize impact - such as the coordination between programs to improve the business environment; to institute better contract enforcement and alternative dispute resolution methods in the rule of law sector; and to offer integrated economic growth and governance support programs in municipalities. II. SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The overall objective of the Senior Economic Growth Advisor is to provide USAID Mission with necessary advice and policy and strategic support for making informed decisions regarding the performance of Economic Growth Office (EGO) programs in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and impact, and also to make recommendations on any possible change in the project development and implementation strategies.

"AID-521- ","Notice of intent to modify contract # AID-521-C-15-00013-00","The Office of Acquisition and Assistance,   USAID/Haiti intends to modify Contract Number AID-521-C-15-00013-00 with DFS Construction, LLC, # 25 Shaw Street, Annapolis, Maryland 21401. The modification will extend the contract for a period of 10 months from February 24, 2016 to December 23, 2016 and increase the total estimated cost by approximately $2, 2,000,000. The purpose of the modification is to continue to execute the structural repairs in housing units, improvement of site storm water drainage system, and reconstruction of the potable water supply and sanitary sewerage distribution systems.   The above contract was awarded to DFS Construction, LLC on a Limited Competition on September 26, 2015 for ceiling price of $7,923,082. The purpose of the project is to make vital repairs at the EKAM site; these include repairs to masonry wall to reinforce the units and protect against seismic (earthquake) forces, repairs to roofs to protect against high winds (hurricane) and to prevent leakage, repairs to the sanitation system to enable adequate wastewater treatment and infiltration into the ground, and repairs to the water distribution system to improve water flow and pressure, among others.  USAID/Haiti intends to solicit and negotiate non-competitively with only one source (DFS) under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5). The required services include continuation of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. This extension allows for the continuation of integral ongoing project activities and sustainability of projects implemented under the contract. Seeking a new procurement to fulfill these ongoing services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming.  There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Therefore, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested persons may, however, identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. The Government will consider all expressions of interest received within a seven(7) calendar days after date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed Contract modification based upon responses, if any, to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.","N/A","Jun 7, 2016","Jun 7, 2016","Special Notice","Launa Lherisson | Deborah Simms-Brown","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Residential Remodelers","CONSTRUCT OF STRUCTURES/FACILITIES","N/A","N/A"

Launching a competition at this stage of the activity would result in a duplication of costs and efforts, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The Partnerships for Development (PfD) activity is the flagship USAID economic policy, legal reform and governance improvement program in Kosovo. This extension for continued services under the present task order will supplement the program with resources needed to further the progress achieved to date and allow USAID to conclude a number of on-going, long-standing initiatives as well as continue to respond to Government of Kosovo's urgent needs. The statutory authority permitting the award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(a)(2), which says that ""full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purpose of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation."" It further states in 706.302-70(b)(5) that this authority may be used for an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.

POSITION DESCRIPTION: A. BACKGROUND The creation of Europe's newest state has proceeded on a forward path despite setbacks. Today, Kosovo functions as a state with an operational government and society after having emerged from a post conflict environment. The 2012 end of ""supervised independence"" and closure of the International Civilian Office (ICO) represented a success and served to highlight the young state's growing maturity and capacity. Government institutions, particularly at the central level, continue to strengthen their operations, and the decentralization of authority to local municipalities reinforces local governance and democratic development. The country has adopted a democratic Constitution, established a Constitutional Court, and has an adequate body of laws and policies, although implementation and enforcement of laws proves poor. Kosovo has held eight peaceful, albeit flawed, elections. Municipal elections were held in the fall of 2013 and parliamentary elections in June 2014. The former resulted in Government of Kosovo mayors and Municipal Assemblies being established in the Serb-majority northern municipalities for the first time, and the latter turned into a six-month political stalemate, only resolved through the formation of a coalition disliked by most of the population. To date, 98 countries have recognized Kosovo, but it still lacks official recognition by many countries. This has prevented Kosovo's membership in the United Nations and other global organizations and has led the European Union to adopt a ""status neutral"" policy towards Kosovo that hampers its ability to fully promote its development. The GoK and the Government of Serbia (GoS) signed an Agreement to Normalize Relations in the spring of 2013 (i.e. ""Brussels Agreement"") and this represents one of Kosovo's most notable international achievements to date. Implementation of the Agreement has been uneven, and only recently has an announcement been made that one of the most integral pieces-the Association of Serb Municipalities-will soon be launched. Serious challenges have arisen in integrating the Kosovo Serb courts in the North into the Kosovo Judiciary despite the February 2015 Justice Sector Agreement, and corruption ranks as one of the biggest problems facing the country. The GoK remains committed to addressing minority issues but faces internal pressures and societal demands that that emphasize the ethnic Albanian character of the state at the expense of minorities and some ultra-nationalists Kosovo Serbs continue to resist integration. Lack of awareness about the Brussels Agreement among the population and inability to have direct dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade further slow progress on ethnic integration. Kosovo has the poorest economy in the region and struggles with high levels of poverty, massive unemployment (estimated at 45%), and over-dependence on imports combined with a very small export sector and energy shortages. The country's Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is estimated at $3,520, ranked 93rd worldwide and behind Macedonia, Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. USAID and other donors have expended considerable investments in assisting the GoK to stand up the institutions of government. To address the challenges discussed above, USAID/Kosovo drafted a Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), FY 2014-FY 2018 to guide USAID assistance efforts in making these institutions more effective. USAID/Democracy and Governance (DG) Portfolio Overview: Despite the existence of the institutions of governance, Kosovars voice frustration and impatience with the progress in implementing good governance and the rule of law. The court system remains inefficient and has yet to demonstrate its full independence. The Assembly has proven slow in enacting legislation and exercising oversight of the executive branch. Progress has stalled on the decentralization of power to municipal governments as mandated in the Constitution. USAID believes it critical to start making government work in an accountable and effective manner for the people of Kosovo. Effective and accountable governance will attract foreign investment, increase the country's respect in the international community, and inspire confidence in citizens that they can and should take an active role in their country's development. USAID/Kosovo's CDCS calls for shifting the focus from establishing the foundations for democracy to making democratic governance function. This requires having an impact on the supply and demand sides of democratic governance by helping to make government more effective and open to accountability as well as strengthening the mechanisms through which citizens can represent their interests in government and hold state institutions accountable. This necessitates a substantial investment in assisting the justice system to start delivering justice more efficiently and independently of government influence or corruption. Finally, this strategy requires USAID/Kosovo to have a particular focus on the implementation and accountability of governance at the local level where most of the work of government should occur. The DG portfolio has a multi-sector focus with eighteen programs (contracts, cooperative agreements, grants and government-to-government) and needs a senior level expert who has a broad understanding and experience with the plethora of activities in a DG portfolio. An additional design is planned in FY2017 for local governance, while support is needed on Technical Evaluation Committees, and in office workload management. The objective of this US PSC is to provide overall strategic and management support to the Democracy and Governance Office (DG) of USAID/Kosovo. The Governance Advisor will serve as the Acting DG Office Director managing the entire USAID/Kosovo DG portfolio. The position requires an individual who can work independently with minimal supervision, exercise excellent verbal and written skills, apply exemplary planning techniques, support FSN team members, multi-task and prioritize deadlines, and exercise quality control over all documents being sent for approval. In light of the Brussels Agreement, representational responsibilities for this position will take a portion of the Advisor's time and this individual will engage with high level USG, donor and counterpart officials. These officials include the Chair of the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC), the General Secretary for the Ministry of Local Government Administration, the Minister of Justice, various mayors and municipal officials. The portfolio has a number of cross-sector activities with the DG Office teams, Economic Growth teams and participates actively in multiple donor and different USG Mission working groups, including representing USAID on the US Embassy's ROL/Anti-corruption working group and a significant role in the Embassy's Minority Engagement Working Group. Achieving peace and stability in the Balkans through integration of minority groups is the top USG foreign policy priority for this region and will require a senior-level USAID expert with both managerial and technical skills and diplomatic acumen. The USAID Mission in Kosovo is the largest in the Balkan region and is the second largest donor in Kosovo after the European Union (EU). With an active portfolio valued at over $220 million, USAID Kosovo is staffed with 97 positions (13 U. S. Direct Hires [USDHs], 10 U.S. Personal Services Contractors [USPSCs], and 74 Foreign Service Nationals [FSNs]). The Mission also provides legal, contracting, and executive office support services to other USAID missions throughout the Balkan region. USAID's DG Office currently has eleven staff: US Direct Hire (USDH) Office Director; USDH Deputy Director; two FSN Advisors for Rule of Law; FSN Local Government And Public Administration Specialist; FSN Civil Society and Political Competition Program Manager; FSN Democracy and Governance Program Manager; FSN Program Management Specialist/Engineer; FSN Program Management/Development Assistance Specialist -Team Leader; FSN Project Specialist for Minority Engagement; and FSN Project/Administrative Assistant. The DG portfolio includes activities in the following areas: rule of law; commercial law; property law; alternative dispute resolution; minority integration; conflict resolution; local governance; elections; parliament/assemblies; civil society; and vulnerable populations. The USPSC reports to the Mission Director or Deputy Mission Director or his/her designee.

"SOL-268-16-000003","Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE)","The United States Agency for International Development, Lebanon (USAID/Lebanon) intends to release Solicitation Number SOL-268-16-000003, for a project titled ""Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE)"". The purpose of the activity is to improve livelihoods, support micro finance and expand inclusive finance in Lebanon. The USAID contemplates award of a five-year cost-plus-fixed fee (CPFF) completion type contract. The anticipated award date is o/a September 2016. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services). This procurement will be conducted under full and open competition procedures, pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1). The anticipated date for posting the solicitation is April 13, 2016 and the anticipated closing date to submit proposals is May 12, 2016.  There is currently no incumbent contractor performing the work. DESCRIPTION The purpose of the Livelihoods and Inclusive Finance Expansion (LIFE) project is to improve economic opportunities and livelihoods of low income individuals and microenterprises by expanding and strengthening microfinance associations' and member institutions' services and enhancing entrepreneurs' business skills. To this end, LIFE will improve livelihoods, strengthen microfinance activities and advance inclusive finance. Inclusive Finance, also referred to as financial inclusion, is defined as ""universal access to a broad range of financial services, at a reasonable cost, provided by a diversity of sound and sustainable institutions."" LIFE will consolidate the gains made under the Lebanon Investment in Microfinance Program (LIM) and expand inclusive finance to the unbanked and higher-risk, micro business clientele. BACKGROUND Development Challenge Approximately one-fourth of Lebanon's population, more than 1.0 million people, live on $4/day, less than one-fifth of the country's average per capita income. Those people tend to live in remote rural areas where job opportunities and access to municipal and financial services are minimal. Unsurprisingly, these areas were the hardest hit in terms of the refugee influx, which has made living conditions even harder. Growing income disparity, limited job opportunities, due in part to excessive policy constraints to new investments and job creation, and poor public service delivery systems have led to widespread citizen dissatisfaction, thus giving sectarian organizations an opportunity to gain a foothold in the population in exchange for political-confessional loyalty. To the extent possible, this project will seek opportunities in these vulnerable groups. Among these groups, women, youth, and people with disabilities are largely excluded and underserved when it comes to economic empowerment and access to basic financial services. The unemployment rate for persons with disabilities globally is much higher than non-disabled individuals. Lebanon has an excellent reputation for maintaining high international standards and sound policies in the banking and the financial sector. However, the lack of key conducive policies impedes access to finance and technology by the poor and by low-income micro enterprises (MEs). Also, MEs located in hard-to reach areas experiencing conflict and political instability fare worse. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has developed a Microfinance Index, which ranks countries based on their ability to develop and expand microfinance services. In 2014, the EIU ranked Lebanon 50th among 55 countries examined, based on its microfinance index. In 2011 only 37% of the population (over age 15) had an account at a formal financial institution. For women in particular, this percentage was lower at 25.9% according to the Global Partnership on Financial Inclusion. Thus, there is a clear need for greater financial inclusion in Lebanon, specifically in rural areas where unemployment exceeds 40%. Inadequate and ineffective government regulation concerning microfinance and the sub-optimal delivery of financial and business services have led to uneven access to finance and unbalanced economic growth. Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) comprise approximately 95% of Lebanese-owned businesses, employ from two to ten persons, mainly draw upon household family members, and borrow at levels of less than $17,000. In contrast, low-income rural microenterprises borrow at much lower levels ($500 - $ 1,700) due to: less borrowing capacity; scarcity of commercial credit at favorable terms and in sufficiently large loan amounts that would support growth; limited technical know-how at the enterprise level and basic business skills; and a non-inclusive financial landscape. (1) Not unlike other countries, where the rural population and microenterprises can access lending, microfinance in Lebanon typically has higher rates, shorter terms, and requires high collateral. Compounding this issue, the steady influx of Syrian refugees - estimated at more than 1.5 million, approximately 30% of Lebanon's population, increases competition for scarce rural jobs and threatens political and social stability. The availability of microfinance and related entrepreneurial development skills and innovation, provides low-income and poor rural households with economic opportunities to identify new income sources and generate additional income. These essential services are often not available to persons with disabilities for a variety of reasons including physical barriers (i.e. inaccessible buildings and information), institutional barriers (i.e. discriminatory policy or standards), and attitudes/social barriers (i.e. stigma and discrimination at various levels, refusal to provide services). While the Central Bank has approved mobile payments and banks have started to introduce mobile money transfers, these services are presently only available to middle and high-income segments of the business population. High transaction costs associated with loan repayments, the absence of policies conducive to financial inclusion, and the lack of a specialized capacity within the regulatory agencies to foster and accelerate the pace of growth of the microfinance sector continue to impede performance of the sector. Present efforts to expand inclusive finance in Lebanon are overwhelmingly limited to the provision of microcredit and support for the adoption and scaling-up of best practices. Furthermore, efforts to expand the adoption of new technologies and innovative products in the financial sector are lacking. As a consequence, the financial enabling environment, level of development and competition in the microfinance sector is low, resulting in Lebanon's low microfinance index ranking. Also, inadequate support for women entrepreneurs widens the gender gap, slows development, and misses an opportunity to stabilize and bolster the resiliency of rural communities for coping with stress. This is especially noticeable in conflict prone areas where, ironically, women are counted on to rebuild their communities, strengthen household resiliency, and provide for the well-being of their families. MFIs, NGOs, business associations, and other key stakeholders individually do not have the technical, institutional, and financial ability to effectively advocate for policy changes in the microfinance sector. Needed policy reforms include: 1) enabling MFIs to accept savings deposits from their members or develop innovative ways for members to accumulate savings; 2) allowing MFIs to borrow from commercial banks or from the Central Bank to widen and deepen their financial intermediation role and expand their capital and lending base; 3) facilitating sharing of credit information on cross-over borrowing through privately owned and operated credit bureau information exchanges; and, 4) broadening MFIs' capacities, as well as other institutions, to provide financial inclusion type services that offer new opportunities for low income family micro businesses to improve their livelihoods and resiliency. Such reforms would reduce barriers to growth and development of the sector bringing Lebanon's microfinance sector up to par with other countries in the Levant. Moreover, MFIs need assistance to evolve into profit making entities, and develop on-lending arrangements with commercial banks or other international lending facilities to better support the microfinance sector with best practices. Currently and over the near to medium future, the MFIs are the only institutions that can provide the financial services to micro businesses and low-income households. The rural poor, particularly women, youth, and the physically impaired, and many of the low income or microenterprise businesses do not have a source or means to improve and advance their entrepreneurship skills or learn best practices as formal educational institutions do not provide continuing education opportunities to low income households or informal microenterprise owners. Lebanon must expand its inclusive finance in order to expand its microfinance sector to be on the same plane with global best practices. To illustrate, only 37% of the population (over age 15) had an account at a formal financial institution in 2011, and women and youth (aged between 18 and 35) comprise a large percentage of microenterprise borrowers.(2) The history of microfinance shows that innovations will stem from supply side insights together with a fresh in-depth understanding of the financial lives of poor households. Due to the small number of sustainable MFIs, lack of regulation governing the microfinance sector, and a proliferation of low-cost approaches for disseminating improved and affordable technologies and services, there is substantial room for progress towards greater financial inclusion in Lebanon. For instance, mobile banking, online money transfers and greater application of digitalization can reduce costs and increase the quality of services significantly in Lebanon. From the supply side, financial inclusion and microfinance are means to advance opportunities for microenterprises in rural areas of Lebanon. Looking at the demand side, i.e. individuals and/or microenterprises in rural areas of Lebanon, there exists a good portion of these who do not even qualify for financial services offered by the above-mentioned institutions due to lack of collateral and steady income. This group includes high risk rural, unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired. Microfinance or financial inclusion support for this group is not effective. The type of support needed at this end is a ""jump-start"" or ""livelihoods"" support that will first make these individuals or microenterprises productive and economically viable and then at a later stage bring them in the financial ecosystem. Lebanon's, physiography, hydrology, and well-developed rural-urban market linkages demonstrate promise for economic growth opportunities especially within the low-income rural areas. Furthermore, Lebanon is endowed with temperate and tropical climatic conditions suited to the cultivation of a diverse range of fruit, vegetable, grain, and niche market crops, and livestock. Its abundant coastal marine resources and fisheries, a relatively well-maintained physical infrastructure throughout the country, significant irrigated and high-input agricultural production systems, and proven Lebanese entrepreneurship hold promise for robust economic growth, especially in the rural areas (3). OBJECTIVE The LIFE project is comprised of three components: 1) Inclusive Finance that will elevate the microfinance discourse by bringing about key policy and institutional changes with the potential to transform the financial inclusion landscape - a proven approach for developing a vibrant, sustainable microfinance sector and economically empowering the unbanked, low-income, and underserved micro clientele; 2) Microcredit that will strengthen the capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the Lebanese Microfinance Association (LMA) to increase their range of products and services and expand their reach of borrowers to include microenterprises with an emphasis on higher-risk, conflict affected areas (areas where economic pressures and social tensions have increased significantly as a result of the high influx of refugees), including new, unbanked, and existing microenterprises, and low-income women-headed households. LIFE will provide customized business management training, technical know-how, mentoring, basic business development skills, and new lending products to the MFI's current and potential clientele; and 3) Livelihoods that will provide grant support and basic business training to microenterprises and individuals that are excluded from the financial ecosystem and economic value chains, but because of lack of collateral and steady income or revenues, are considered too high of a credit risk to qualify for microcredit from the MFIs. The purpose of these grants, along with business development services, is to give these microenterprises the chance to grow and become potential MFI clients. This group includes high risk rural poor, including unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired and certain microenterprises. The contractor will identify and propose the appropriate and capable stakeholders to receive USAID assistance. Potential stakeholders and counterparts may include, but are not limited to: the LMA, MFIs, Commercial Banks, the Central Bank of Lebanon, local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), new and established microenterprises, Kafalat (a local guarantee provider), etc. The LIFE project is expected to target all regions in rural areas of Lebanon, with special emphasis on areas labeled ""host communities"", which are currently hosting a large number of refugees (4). STATEMENT OF WORK Overview of Components and Technical Approach LIFE is premised on the development hypothesis that the livelihoods of Lebanon's poorest people will improve significantly only if they can access support services of two kinds, financial and non-financial. LIFE will therefore take steps to make both kinds of services more readily available to the country's marginalized populations, matching the services to the specific business problems clients' face. In other words, LIFE will not be a set of solutions looking for a problem, but a project that tailors its solutions to the problems actually encountered by poor people. That said, USAID's experience under LIM and more generally suggests that finance is indeed a major constraint to Lebanon's poor significantly increasing their incomes. For that reason, it is anticipated that LIFE will devote a substantial proportion of its resources to questions of finance on both the program and policy front. Therefore, if: 1) targeted state and non-state institutions act to create the enabling environment for a more inclusive finance landscape; 2) regulations and guidelines to implement the policy are developed; and 3) staff is trained to carry out the existing and new policies, then it is quite plausible that access to microcredit, microbusiness development services, and technical skills and mentoring in areas of both technical and financial aspects of microbusiness development will increase. Such an improvement in the finance and information symmetry will help to bring out the concept of national financial inclusiveness for supporting broad-based economic growth. At the same time, demand for microfinance service and entrepreneurial development services will increase significantly as has been demonstrated worldwide. Increased availability of efficient microfinance service delivery entities will result in a more dynamic and robust business environment for microbusinesses to grow and flourish. This will lead to increased employment, increased demand for improved service delivery systems for continuing entrepreneurship education for low-income households and micro-businesses to improve their productivity and added value to a changing market. A cycle will thus be initiated in which steadily increasing demand for effective and efficient financial service delivery results in improved service delivery, which in turn results in greater supply and availability, and quality services that are competitively priced. This premise is supported by microfinance-specific literature that is replete with examples of the critical importance of a ""national financial inclusion"" strategy and actions for improving microfinance access by low-income, rural microenterprises and economically marginalized households in particular (5) . It will be recalled that Lebanon's unbanked population (aged 15 and over and without access to financial intermediation comprise 37% of the population and operate the majority of businesses that employ only two family members) are starved for working capital and lack the skills and knowledge for adopting best entrepreneurial practices and innovation. This approach reflects the June 2011 call from USAID Administrator Shah that ""USAID's efforts must be grounded in a deeper understanding of the words ""country ownership"" that encompasses not simply government in its approach, but the gamut of stakeholders, including the end users themselves."" The overall purpose of the LIFE project is to contribute to the achievement of USAID/Lebanon's stated goal of ""increased access to finance, especially for new business start-ups and women entrepreneurs and enhance entrepreneurs' business skills."" More specifically, LIFE's efforts will result in the outcome ""strengthened micro-finance association and member institutions."" Toward this end, LIFE will, in light of the positive mid-term evaluation of the LIM program, implement the recommendations by further strengthening the capacity of NGOs that will be engaged in providing customized hands-on training and mentorship of microenterprises. Emphasis will be on the underserved and hard-to-reach microenterprises, and new microenterprise start-ups in higher-risk and conflict affected areas including women led low-income rural households. Also, LIFE will facilitate, nurture, and strengthen a network of institutions and stakeholders aimed at providing sustainable support to microenterprise development and inclusive finance support. Microenterprises and entrepreneurs that qualify for microcredit will be the targeted beneficiaries under the microcredit component. High risk, low income or unemployed rural women and youth, as well as microenterprises that do not qualify for microcredit from the MFIs will be the target beneficiaries of the Livelihoods component and eligible for grant support and technical training. The LIFE project will build on the initial successes and lessons of the LIM initiative and advance the goals of improving livelihoods, supporting microfinance activity, and expanding national financial inclusion of the unbanked and low-income households under the following three components: 1) Inclusive Finance will aim to bring about a minimum of three significant policy/institutional changes that will bring many more clients into the financial ecosystem and expand national financial inclusion- an essential element for developing a vibrant, sustainable microfinance sector and economically empowering the unbanked, low-income, and underserved micro clientele; 2) Microcredit will strengthen the capacity of MFI's and LMA to increase their range of products and services and to expand their reach of borrowers to include microenterprises with an emphasis on higher-risk, conflict affected areas (areas where economic pressures and social tensions have increased significantly as a result of the high influx of refugees) including new, unbanked, and existing microenterprises, and low-income women-headed households. LIFE will provide customized business management training, technical know-how, mentoring, basic business development skills, and new lending products to the MFI's current and potential clients; and 3) Livelihoods will provide grant support and basic business training to individuals and microenterprises who would like to participate in the financial ecosystem and economic value chains, but who, because of lack of collateral and steady income, are considered too high of a credit risk to qualify for microcredit from the MFIs. This group includes high risk rural, unemployed or low income women, youth and the physically impaired. Component 1: Inclusive Finance Microfinance is the means to achieving the inclusive finance objective. Microfinance includes the full range of financial services offered in any financial ecosystem, such as savings, funds transfers, payments, credit histories and credit scoring, warehouse receipts, insurance and credit. Because microcredit is critically important to microfinance, and to build on the achievements of the LIM project in this area, microcredit is included as a separate stand-alone component below. The primary objective of the ‘Inclusive Finance"" component is to bring about a minimum of three significant policy/institutional changes that would expand national financial inclusion. USAID/ Lebanon conducted an assessment of the overall microfinance landscape and the following four key policy/institutional changes emerged as top priorities to expand financial inclusion: • enable MFIs to accept savings deposits from their members; • allow borrowing from commercial banks or the Central Bank to widen and deepen the financial intermediation role of MFIs and expand their capital and lending base; • facilitate sharing of credit information on cross-over borrowing through privately operated credit bureau information exchanges; and • Broaden MFIs' capacities to provide financial inclusion type services that offer new opportunities for low income family micro businesses to improve their livelihoods and resiliency. Out of these four findings, it is realistic to assume that the last three changes above can be implemented under the LIFE program. If implemented, these reforms could result in significant numbers of currently marginalized Lebanese entering the financial ecosystem and benefiting from opportunities to engage in productive activities and earn more income. This component will work closely with the Central Bank, LMA, and MFIs to translate the reforms from ideas into reality. The relevant literature on microfinance emphasizes the critical importance of national financial inclusion in improving access to financial services for microenterprises and individuals who are excluded from the financial sector (6). Financial inclusion clearly defines and aligns a shared vision among policy makers, MFIs, and other stakeholders for achieving an inclusive financial sector. It represents a shared vision of the role microfinance can play in a country's development and increase people's access to financial services. These strategies are nationally-owned and developed in a consultative process with key stakeholders. The process is policy/institutional changes that outline strategies, approaches, and actions to expand access of poor and low income people to finance services. The LIFE project will provide technical assistance and support to the LMA and the Central Bank to work on these policy/institutional changes. Component 2: Microcredit This component will provide support to microfinance institutions and the LMA with the aim of increasing microcredit products and services available for microenterprises and entrepreneurs in niche markets where access to credit is not readily available. Similar to LIM, this component will work on capitalizing MFIs in order for them to provide new targeted microfinance products and services and provide them with technical assistance that is essential for developing these products. This strategic approach is consistent with a key LIM evaluation recommendation ""to target higher-risk categories of potential borrowers to be specifically reached by a portion of sub-grant funds or underwritten through a credit guarantee."" In other words, should a credit guarantee scheme be used, it would be mainly for MFIs to raise additional funding from banks, with the USG as a guarantor. Technical assistance under this component will also target loan recipients. This component will also emphasize conflict-affected areas of high unemployment and high numbers of unbanked individuals. The difference between activity under this component and activity under LIM is this component targets beneficiaries better through greater outreach. This component's activities will support the microfinance sector while at the same time expand financial inclusion, one of the main aims of the program. This component aims to increase access to finance by the unbanked, hard-to-reach borrowers by the end of the program. As a corollary, and in aggregate, it is expected that the lending capital portfolio dedicated to higher-risk, underserved microbusinesses increases by several-fold throughout the project period, with commercial banks providing a significant share of the additional lending capital. Under this component, assistance will be compliant with ADS 219, which specifies conditions to delivering assistance to MFIs. Component 3: Livelihoods This component will provide grant support and training to individuals who are currently excluded from the financial sector's products and services who do not meet the requirements for receiving loans from the MFIs. There is a large group of potential entrepreneurs and microenterprises which does not qualify for microloans from the MFIs -even those with credit guarantees and other credit enhancements, because they lack the collateral and stable income necessary to secure and enable repayment of the loans. This group includes many of the rural poor including low income or unemployed women, youth, and physically impaired. LIFE will strive to link individuals and microenterprises in this target population into economic value chains and bring them into the financial ecosystem by providing them with market-linkage grants and basic business training. The assistance package may include customized technical and soft business development skills training and mentoring as well as limited market linkage grants for investment capital to enable potential entrepreneurs and microenterprises to acquire small pieces of capital equipment. Existing commercial training modules will be administered by organizations that specialize in providing entrepreneurial and basic business development technical skills training and mentorship across various small-scale enterprises of relevance to the Lebanese rural landscape and urban markets. A series of focused thematic training totaling about 50 hours of training per individual administered over a series of weeks. The project will identify NGOs that cater to filling these needs and are exclusive to the MFI partners involved with the microfinance aspects of the project. Assistance under this component is mainly aimed at improving livelihoods through increased income and/or increased employment. --- (1) UNHCR is constantly updating a risk classification of areas in Lebanon based on the number of hosted registered refugees (2) The U.S. Library of Congress (3) The Agricultural Sector of Lebanon, UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Beirut, Lebanon, October 1, 2013 (4) UNHCR is constantly updating a risk classification of areas in Lebanon based on the number of hosted registered refugees (5) The New Microfinance Handbook, a Financial Market System Perspective, edited by Joanna Ledgerwood with Julie Earne and Candace Nelson, the World Bank 2013.

"SOl-521-16-000018","Cap Haitien Port Civil Works","This is a Draft Solicitation for Design Build services for the Rehabilitation of the Cap Haitien Port (CHP) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number 521-16-000018 is being issued as a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP). This Draft does not constitute a formal solicitation of offers. Proposals will not be evaluated based upon this announcement. It is anticipated that a Final Solicitation will be released in June 2016. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 236220. This procurement action is unrestricted and full and open competition. 1. Description of Services U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID/HAITI) plans to obtain design and construction services for the rehabilitation of the Cap Haitien Port located in Cap Haitien, Haiti. The Preliminary Designs attached to this notice represent the initial design requirements for CHP. The following outlines the basic Civil Works design requirements in the Preliminary Design document and represent the physical work to be completed under this draft solicitation. The main dimensions of the design container vessel, which will be used as a basis for dimensioning of the navigational areas, are given below. Parameter Unit Overall length m 200 Beam m 28 Scantling draft m 10.9 Carrying capacity dwt 25,000 TEU 1,700 Displacement t 34,100 a. Cruise Quay, Mooring Dolphin and Access Bridge Although a design vessel with a length of 200m should be considered, the standard 1,700 TEU container vessel that will reach the port is approximately only 180m. Therefore the quay shall be designed to be able to accommodate a 180m long vessel under any weather conditions. For mooring a 200m vessel, a 185m long quay would also be sufficient as head ropes can be attached as spring ropes and stern ropes to the mooring dolphin located 25m from the end of the quay. The quay shall be wide enough to provide parking and working space for the mobile harbor crane and at the same time allow for safe and clear passage of truck traffic along the quay. The width of the quay at the north and south end sections is considered with 30m to allow trucks to turn on the quay and 25m at the interior. A new 10m wide access bridge is also required to connect the Cruise Quay to the terminal. b. Commercial Quay The proposed dimensions of the new Commercial Quay are approximately 175m x 18m. Due to required safety clearance (depth limitation) to the existing RoRo quay, 190m of new quay structure have to be built. c. Dredging Works and hydrologic Survey In order to allow ships with a greater draft to enter the port area, it is necessary to adapt the approach channel alignment and dredge parts of the channel. In addition, a turning circle must be arranged to allow ships to turn before or after berthing the Container Quay. To accommodate the design vessel, parts of the navigational areas will be dredged to a level of -12.0 m to -12.5 hydro. The dredging volume of those areas was calculated to 255,000 m³. Both the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Chart 26147 and the hydrographic survey indicate that dredging is only required in the harbor basin, the turning circle and the last meters of the approach channel, as natural depths are sufficient in all other parts. In the northern stretch of the channel however the depths are only slightly below the required depth of -12.5 m hydro. It is therefore imperative to perform a comprehensive hydrographic survey along the approach channel and the port area before the start of construction in order to validate the calculations above d. Quay Wall Furniture The new quays shall be equipped with fenders, bollards and safety ladders. e. Navigation Aids Aids to Navigation are used to safely guide ships heading through the approach channel and to mark local dangers, points of interests and limits of navigational areas. Recommendations and guidelines for the arrangement of Aids to Navigation are published by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). These guidelines shall be used for the design of navigational aids for Cap Haïtien. Currently, a set of different marks exist in Cap Haïtien. The existing main approach channel is marked with beacons on starboard and port side however marks listed on US NGA Chart 26147 are known to be missing or out of position. The choice of the type, quantity and features of the marks depends on a set of factors, like local bathymetry and dangers, meteorological conditions, traffic volumes and also available budget. With these considerations in mind, it was chosen to consider only the minimum required standards for safe navigation due to the financial constraints in this project. The addition of more aids is possible with relatively little effort even at later project stages if this is deemed necessary and sufficient funding is available. 2.

INTRODUCTION The Republic of Burundi is a land-locked country located in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. With an estimated 2015 population of 11.1 million, and a life expectancy of just 51 years, it remains one of the ten poorest countries in the world. 90% of households are agricultural with average land plots of 0.2 hectares per family. Chronic malnutrition remains prevalent and many rural households are food insecure. Malaria is considered a major public health problem in Burundi and places a heavy burden on the health system. According to Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) statistics, malaria is responsible for up to 60% of all outpatient visits and up to 50% of deaths in health facilities among children under five years of age. Almost the entire population of Burundi lives in areas at risk of malaria. The most up-to-date information on the status of malaria prevention and control interventions in Burundi comes from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and the 2012 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). These surveys showed that only 14% of children under five with a fever in the two weeks preceding the survey received an artemisinin-based combination therapy within 24 hours. At the same time, the use of preventive measures is increasing and the Government of Burundi has a goal to achieve and maintain universal net coverage with one ITN per two people. Burundi has made progress on key indicators with dramatic increases in the number of children who slept under Long Lasting Impregnated nets (LLINs) from 8% in 2005 (MICS) to 59% in 2010 (DHS) and to 63% in 2012 (MIS). The use of these nets for pregnant women increased in the same proportion as well. Burundi is actively looking for strategies to promote preventative treatment for pregnant women and other at-risk segments of the population. USAID's programs in country work to support Burundi's third national malaria strategy promulgated in November 2013 (Plan Strategic National de Lutte Contre le Paludisme). USAID and the Global Fund together provide 90% of malaria control funding in Burundi. Burundi is currently designated as a post authorizing only adult dependents employed at the Embassy.

"RFI-182-16-000001","REQUEST FOR INFORMATION USAID/Albania Transparency in Healthcare Engagement (THE) Activity","Dear Potential Offerors, USAID/Albania is in the process of finalizing the design for the Mission's Transparency in Healthcare Engagement (THE) activity. This activity will focus on corruption in the health sector and will encourage the cooperation of selected independent government institutions with civil society organizations and media to urge for more responsible governance in health leading to improved health services for Albanian citizens. USAID believes that working to strengthen the cooperation of the High Inspectorate for the Declaration and Audit of Assets and the Prevention of Conflict of Interest (HIDAA), the High State Audit (HSA), and the Ombudsman, with civil society and media, provides opportunities for increasing public demand against corruption in the health sector while strengthening the performance of these institutions and making it transparent for the public to monitor. HIDAA collects and audits the annual declaration of assets and properties of around 5,000 mid- and high-level public officials in central and local executive agencies and supervises the prevention of conflicts of interest. Since its creation in 2003, HIDAA has gone a long way into establishing itself as an important anticorruption institution. Gradually over the years, the filing rate of public officials has increased, and cooperation with local public and private institutions has improved, HIDAA has referred more cases to prosecutors, and their cases have been stronger over time. HIDAA has also gained a reputation for being a transparent institution in offering public information of public officials' assets upon request. In order to be able to fulfill its watchdog role, HIDAA must have adequate tools to be able to collect, analyze, store, and retrieve the declarations of public officials. Currently, HIDAA must scan all public officials' declarations in a simple system that USAID helped establish about ten years ago. The current system is quite primitive. It allows for retrieval of declaration forms by name of public officials, but it is not able to make any calculations on the evolution of assets over the years. This has become even more difficult after recent changes in the law that have tripled the number of full investigations that HIDAA is required to conduct and simplified public requests for information by removing fees for service. Under such circumstances, a modern electronic asset declaration system would enable HIDAA to better perform its functions while also remaining transparent and accessible to the public. USAID/Albania requests information on the development and maintenance costs of an electronic document management system, to be owned and maintained by HIDAA, to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in performing its oversight role. Minimum system requirements include: • Compatibility with Government of Albania IT standards • Compatibility with file formats of previous declaration submissions • Automation or improved facilitation of scanning old declaration submissions • Ability of scanned documents to be mined for data • Produce statistical reports on the evolution of properties over the years • Ease of searching, exporting, and publishing data and reports, including to the internet • Electronic filing function for public officials Given the critical nature of the activity, we're reaching out to you, our potential offerors, to get comments/suggestions on the above draft portion of the statement of work (SOW). USAID requests respondents to include a brief description of the proposed system and a ballpark estimate of the total cost to develop and field the system, including initial set-up costs, training costs for HIDAA staff and maintenance costs. The description should note whether proprietary or off-the-shelf hardware and software is recommended. Please note that the figure in USAID's Business Forecast is only a place-holder and not indicative of this work. This is an RFI and not a Request for Proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to issue any solicitation or to pay for any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of comments on this RFI.

Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package will be limited to this electronic medium. Accordingly, interested vendors, especially small business, are encouraged to register themselves as an interested vendor.   The United States Agency for International Development, Cambodia (USAID/Cambodia) intends to release a solicitation for a project titled “Cambodia Malaria Elimination Project” (CMEP). The purpose of this activity is to intensify malaria control and elimination activities by providing technical assistance and support to National Center for Parasitology, Entomology, and Malaria Control (CNM) to further develop, refine, and evaluate an evidence-based Model Elimination Package for malaria in Sampov Loun, which can then be implemented in other appropriate Operation Districts (ODs). Initial work on this package has already begun under the existing Greater Mekong Subregion Control and Prevention of Malaria (CAP-Malaria) Project. This regional project has been implemented in Burma, Thailand and Cambodia by University Research Co, LLC (URC) under cooperative agreement number AID-486-A-12-00001 which will be ending in October 2016.      The Project is intended to contribute to the overall efforts of CNM and partners to eliminate malaria from Cambodia by 2025. It is recognized that several factors may impede progress towards malaria elimination, including intensifying resistance to ACTs, waning finances for malaria elimination activities, and social and economic factors that are beyond the control of this Project. Nonetheless, the tools, approaches and the strengthened surveillance systems developed through this Project will enable Cambodia to move closer to the goal of elimination and equip CNM and partners to move quickly to address such challenges as they arise.    The anticipated solicitation date is on or about December 4, 2015. There is currently no incumbent contractor performing the work.   Except for the above information, no additional information regarding this planned RFP is available at this time.

The specific number of days to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and the Mission. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo AREA OF CONSIDERATION: US Citizens I. POSITION DESCRIPTION: BACKGROUND The USAID Mission for Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo), located in Pristina, manages one of the most important and complex assistance programs in the region. In line with USG and Kosovo priorities, USAID/Kosovo's five-year Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) envisages Kosovo as an effective state, with a viable economy and an inclusive democracy on the path to European integration. The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. Since the end of conflict in Kosovo, USAID has been the key donor in establishing economic policies and a legal and institutional framework in Kosovo. The key institutions, laws, and regulations are generally in place, as is a sound fiscal and financial system. Among the institutions supported by USAID technical assistance were the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK), Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK), the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the Kosovo Pension Savings Trust (KPST), Kosovo Electric Company (Korporata Elektroenergjetike e Kosovës - KEK), Energy Regulatory Office (ERO), Kosovo Veterinary and Food Agency (KVFA), Kosovo Forest Agency (KFA) and others. Much progress has been made in building their capacity. Several, such as the CBK, the KPST, and the privatization agency, now function at a level of proficiency that does not require ongoing donor support. USAID assistance until recently was focused on support for the basic building blocks of an independent Kosovo. For Kosovo to move forward, it needs to establish a clear economic base for development and to consolidate democratic achievements. Consequently, with the new CDCS, USAID assistance is focusing on supporting the private sector, which is best-positioned to determine Kosovo's comparative advantages and best able to increase incomes and jobs. With basic government functions operating with a degree of effectiveness, it is important to ensure that there is a vibrant civil society that is capable of holding the government accountable and demanding rule of law. In addition, USAID has increased its focus on supporting municipalities. Kosovo's central government institutions have achieved remarkable progress in a short period of time. While threats to these gains still remain, support for building the capabilities of local government remain one of the key objectives of USAID assistance in Kosovo. At the center, focus is shifting from establishing institutions to making them functional. Central government institutions still require support to varying degrees of involvement. Over the next five years, the task will be to consolidate and build on successes at the center, and begin to scale back support to those ministries and agencies that are capable of successfully fulfilling their mandate without full-time donor assistance. Support for youth and education is a major new area. Youth-oriented programs play a central role in USAID's portfolio. Youth and education interventions are cross-cutting and based on a strong partnership with the GOK and other stakeholders. A key element of USAID's approach is strong synergies throughout the portfolio to maximize impact - such as the coordination between programs to improve the business environment; to institute better contract enforcement and alternative dispute resolution methods in the rule of law sector; and to offer integrated economic growth and governance support programs in municipalities. II. SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The overall objective of the Senior Development Advisor is to provide USAID Mission with necessary advice and policy and strategic support for making informed decisions regarding the performance of Economic Growth Office (EGO) programs in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and impact, and also to make recommendations on any possible change in the project development and implementation strategies.

"SOL-674-16-000004","Epidemiologist / Senior Strategic Information (SI) Advisor","RHAP’s Development Objective (DO 2) is to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on the southern Africa region.  RHAP accomplishes this goal by providing management and programmatic oversight to the limited presence countries – Lesotho and Swaziland – and by strengthening the quality of PEPFAR programs implemented in 10 countries in the region. Countries included in the region are South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Angola, the Kingdom of Swaziland, and Lesotho.  RHAP technical advisors provide in-presence and virtual support not only to USAID Missions and Offices, but to the entire PEPFAR inter-agency staff within a country.  The region that RHAP supports, Southern Africa, remains the epicenter of the global AIDS epidemic.  According to UNAIDS, in 2014 Swaziland had the highest HIV prevalence in the world at 27.7%, followed by Botswana (25.2%) and Lesotho (23.4%).  The 9 highest-prevalence countries in the world are in southern Africa.  In the region, only Angola, at 2.4% prevalence, has an HIV prevalence of less than 10%.   While the rate of new infections is declining in every country, and the number of people living with HIV who are on antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased more than 30-fold since 2004, there are still enormous challenges to reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation.  In 2014, an estimated 13.6 million people in the region are infected, only 46% (6.4m) of whom are on ART.  To achieve the 90-90-90 goal of 81% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART by 2020, an additional 4.6m PLHIV must be put on ART in the next 5 years. The impact of HIV in the region is also compounded by a rampant tuberculosis epidemic.  With PEPFAR 3.0, countries have focused their programs on sustainable control of the epidemic.  They have adopted a data driven approach to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 global goals and work towards an AIDS-free generation.  Data is a key factor in implementing the PEPFAR pivots and in decision making.  Recent PEFFAR requirements such as the new Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting indicators (MER), Site Improvement through Monitoring Systems (SIMS), Data for Accountability, Transparency and Impact Monitoring (DATIM), and quarterly reporting for the PEPFAR Oversight Accountability Response Team (POART), add to the full complement of SI-related expertise expected of the incumbent of the position. ","Nov 13, 2015 06:00 PM EST","Oct 23, 2015","Oct 23, 2015","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Caroline S.

"SOL-674-15-000046","PEPFAR Country Coordintor","The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) - the U.S. Government initiative to help save the lives of those impacted by HIV/AIDS around the world - is the largest commitment by any nation in history to combat a single disease internationally. PEPFAR investments also help alleviate suffering from other diseases across the global health spectrum. PEPFAR is driven by a shared responsibility among donor and partner nations and others to make smart investments to save lives. Thanks in large part to U.S. leadership, tremendous progress has been made in the fight against global AIDS. PEPFAR has supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 6.7 million men, women and children worldwide as of September 30, 2013. PEPFAR supported 17 million people with care and support, including more than 5 million orphans and vulnerable children, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013. In FY 2013, PEPFAR supported HIV testing and counseling for more than 57.7 million people in FY 2013, providing a critical entry point to prevention, treatment, and care. PEPFAR tested 12.8 million pregnant women and for  780,000 of these women who tested positive for HIV, PEPFAR provided antiretroviral medications to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the virus. Due to PEPFAR support, 95 percent of these babies were born HIV-free (including 240,000 that would otherwise have been infected). Over the past two years, over 1.5 million HIV-positive pregnant women received these interventions to prevent mother-to child transmission and improve maternal health. By September 30, 2013, PEPFAR had also supported more than 4.2 million voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) procedures in east and southern Africa.  Now in its third phase, PEPFAR is continuing to focus on the transition from an emergency response to building sustainable programs. These programs are country-owned and country-driven and address HIV/AIDS with a broader context of health and development. PEPFAR's program builds on past strengths and increases efficiencies by scaling up effective interventions and ensuring value.","Oct 05, 2015 06:00 PM EDT","Oct 5, 2015","Oct 5, 2015","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Caroline S.
